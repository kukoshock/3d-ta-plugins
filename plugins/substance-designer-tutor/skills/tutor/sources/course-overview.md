## Course Description

This comprehensive course equips you with the essential skills to dive into Adobe Substance 3D Designer confidently. Beginning with the basics, we'll guide you through the interface, core concepts, and typical workflows. With this base laid out, you'll be able to make your first steps in Substance 3D Designer: creating a new project, adding and connecting nodes, and previewing them in real time.

We will then begin the creation of a fabric material from scratch: starting from a thread, then weaving it, and finally embroidering procedural ornaments on it. At this point you will start to feel comfortable with Designer node-based workflow, so we'll push things further by introducing hard-surface techniques to create gemstones and sequins.

With the height done, it will be time to add color and roughness information, but also translucency and displacement. Finally, you will learn how to make your material fully dynamic by exposing its parameters, and how to export and reuse it in different software.
