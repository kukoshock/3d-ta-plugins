so we made our thread we made our weave
and now we'd like to embroider ornaments
on top of this plain base to make it
look more appealing and interesting we
have two tasks ahead of us we need to
create the embroidery weave that will be
added to our base Fabric and we need to
create an ornament mask that will
basically tell designer where the
embroidery should appear and since all
you need in the end is a black and white
image you could also simply load
something that you got elsewhere or just
draw it manually in Photoshop for
example this is important I will go back
to this later but you don't necessarily
have to do everything procedurally in
designer now for the sake of this
tutorial we're going to create our
ornament mask from scratch by ourselves
just because it's a great exercise to
get used to shape creation and
manipulation but in the next video I
will also show you the other technique
where you just import a bit map and use
it as a readymade mask and at the end
we'll weigh the pros and cons of each
method all right let's just see how we
can make this mask procedurally we need
some space for that and I could just
move away from the main Arrangement here
and start building something on the side
or if I want to keep things really tidy
and you know I don't want this node
arrangement to get in the way what I
could do is build it in a separate graph
or what we call a subgraph now you
remember when we started a project
designer created for us a substance
package and this package is like a box
in which we can add as many resources as
we like in our case we only have this
ornate fabric graph here that is just
our main graph now in order to add a new
graph to our project we need to come
over to the package here where it says
SBS make sure you're clicking the
package and not the graph people often
get confused by that so on the package
right click go to new substance graph
it's going to ask you the same thing
that when we first started a project so
which temp you want to use uh what
resolution you want to work on and so on
we're going to keep everything at
default and just rename the graph
ornaments don't be confused by that it's
not going to create a new project it's
just going to add another graph inside
your current project and there we go we
now have a nice clean slate to start
building our mask and the good thing
about doing it this way in a separate
space like that is well first we're not
going to clutter our main graph so
that's always a good thing and second
the fact that the ornament mask is now
its own entity means we can always bring
it in other projects okay so let's start
building it now it's time to ask
ourselves what kind of ornament do we
want to make it could be flowers it
could be Stars Hearts geometrical
patterns but even if you don't know
exactly what you want to make designer
can be a good starting point so let's
say I don't really know where I'm
heading and I just want to Doodle until
I find something that sticks I'm going
to start with a simple shape like a disc
for instance but apart from changing its
size I'm pretty limited when it comes to
deforming it or creating something new
out of it so let's search for a note
that could help us with that if we type
in warp you see that we have a whole
family of notes dedicated to just that
let's start with the simple warp the one
with that wobbly grid here all right so
what the warp does if we look at its
description is that it displaces the
pixel of an image following an intensity
map that you plug right here so let me
show you an example real quick if I
connect my disc to it and use another
shape as the intensity
input and use a transform 2D to move it
around you can see that the pixels of my
dis are shifted based on where my shape
is now notice that I'm using a bell
shape for that because it has a nice
soft gradient and if you look at the
intensity input of the war it actually
says gradient input and what that means
is that it's not going to work very well
with sharp inputs see if I change my
belt to something harsher I lose the
clean distortions that I had so keep in
mind when using the warp you need to
choose soft shapes and noises for the
intensity now when it comes to noises I
already know that something like the
peine noise would work well because it
has these large blobs with gentle slopes
it's the perfect candidate for warp so
let's just plug it in now if I play with
the pein properties while previewing the
warp for example let's say I changed the
disorder well I can now see it Ripple
through the dis outline in real time
which is awesome now I'd like to make a
few adjustments uh first I'd like to
make the pein
larger and the warp more intense by
typing in two
here okay now at this stage it's just
just a shapeless blob and I wouldn't
call it an ornament really but here's a
few tricks we can do to turn it into
something interesting the main thing
that is missing here is harmony if we
think of Harmony as a balance between
Chaos and Order right now we have a lot
of chaos here coming from the noise
Randomness and we have zero order one
quick and easy way to structure this
would be to add a mirror the mirror node
does exactly what it says it will mirror
the input on the axis of your choice or
you can also mirror the corners so I'm
just going to cycle through this until I
have something
interesting okay now let's move that
note to the side and what we will do to
refine this result is add a couple more
nodes in between here let's select the
connection first then search for
swirl this one will distort your input
like so like following a spiral shape
and I usually scale it up by two by
clicking here so it's taking in the
whole image then play with the amount to
make it more or less
intense okay I'm not going to Twig it
too much now because I first want to
finish my little setup and I will do
that by just adding a transform 2D here
just to be able to test different looks
simply by moving around my shape before
it enters the mirror now with everything
set up I can finally double click my
mirror to display it in the 2D view then
start playing with some of the previous
notes so I can move the shape
[Music]
around experiment with the
swirl I can even go back to the very
beginning and change the base
disc also maybe play with the
pein and just keep going like that now
this really illustrates the power of
making things procedurally because here
we didn't create one static image but we
actually made a dynamic generator that
can produce endless variations and it's
also a good illustration of what we mean
when we say that the workflow in
designer is nonlinear we can act upon
any point of the graph and it would just
update everything that is connected to
it so I can go back and forth between my
mirror my transform the noise and so on
and now I have this nice shape all right
so that was one way of creating custom
shapes in substance designer now let's
say you don't want to generate just
random shapes because you have a
specific design in mind and you want to
be able to reproduce it procedurally
with more control you could get there
using warps but it would quickly get
tedious instead I'm going to introduce
you to a new family of nodes so let's
move away from this first setup and type
in spline now the spline nodes are a big
family you can spot them with that
yellow color code to get started let's
bring in the spline poly quadratic
node okay now this one looks very
different from what we've been using so
far and with all these inputs and
outputs it can be a bit intimidating but
let me reassure you right away you don't
have to worry about them you will not
have to use them separately uh speaking
of it if I want to grab any of the
outputs you see that they all come
together for me but you may have a
different Behavior where they only come
one by one if that's the case it's
because you are in the wrong connection
mode that's a setting you can change by
going at the top of the tool bar here
where it says link creation mode and we
have different modes here and if I set
it to standard you see it will only let
me grab connections one by one and we
don't want that so make sure you are in
material mode if you want to follow
along okay back to our spline now like I
said you can ignore these inputs for now
so let's focus on the 2D view so we have
a spline here we can just pose it
however we want with these four points
can just drag them around like so so and
that's mostly it you can just draw any
shape by moving points we can go up to
10 points in our poly quadratic uh you
can even go above it using the pointless
node we won't get into that for now I
just encourage you to spend a few
minutes just messing around with the
points to familiarize yourself with the
node now in my case I like to create
some kind of stylized Leaf shape or
blade I'm just going to experiment with
it a bit
something
nice all right now at this point all we
see in the 2D view is a preview it is
not the actual output that we are going
to use and you can already tell that if
you scroll at the bottom of the
properties panel here you have all this
preview setting like the point size the
thickness and so on it's just here to
help us see what we're doing so I made
this sort of leaf blade thing and I'd
like to see it in its final form and not
just as preview so how can I get out of
preview mode there are different nodes I
can use for that so we have spline
render spline mapper but I'm going to
use the scatter on spline Grays scale
for that that's another big node but
don't worry we're not going to dive too
deep into it now to connect our spline
to it all we have to do is take one
input and it would just hook the whole
bundle here all right now it's giving us
this result with all these discs
scattered along along the spine that's
not exactly what we want so we are going
to take that shape spacing slider and
push it down to zero and now we have
something nice and smooth the second
parameter we need to change is in the
size section so we need to switch the
size mode here at the top from normal to
use thickness from spline now all of a
sudden our image has disappeared and
that's because the spline we use doesn't
have any thickness yet so we just need
to go back to it and see that's some
nonlinear workflow in action here and if
we take a look at the properties we see
that each point of the spine actually
has its own properties including
thickness and if I start gently pushing
some of these sliders I instantly see
the results updating in my
scatter so now let me twig these a bit
until I have the desired
look nice and tapered
okay something like that all right so I
made a first blade using this fly node
but what if I wanted to have some sort
of Clump with several blades I would
need several splines for that now you
might be thinking sure no problem we can
just create another one and blend them
together but the thing is splines are a
separate category of object in designer
and you can't really blend them like you
would with ordinary shapes or noises
instead what you can do is append them
in a list now it sounds complex but it's
actually very simple all you have to do
is first you need several splines so let
me just duplicate this one by pressing
contrl D and now to assemble these you
can just take the outputs of the first
spline and connect it to the second one
and now our two splines are grouped in
one list I can render them all together
like so but there are still separate
entities that I can readjust IND
so I'm going to do that a couple more
time
duplicating
reconnecting giving different
poses all right so you now know how to
create specific shapes using splines
it's a bit more advanced but definitely
worth it when you want to have more
control over your shapes to finish this
little plant setup I'd like to add a
flower somewhere in the middle something
really simple and stylized a bit like
the famous Rose designed by Mac which is
just a round base that is crisscrossed
with petal lines that should be fairly
easy I'm going to start with a disc then
add a transform 2D to place
it and here I'm just using a blend to
guide me and see things better somewhere
around
here okay now for the petal lines I'm
going to use two more notes first I like
to be able to extract the outline of
this disc here just to have a nice nice
empty circle and I can use an edge
detect for that this note just traces
the Contour of the input and is very
handy there's not much to change here uh
we can invert it can adjust the
thickness if needed and now what I would
like is to take this circle and Scatter
it randomly and I'm going to use a tile
generator for that because we already
know that note so it will be a good
practice remember we need to change the
pattern to image input then and I'm
going to reduce the number something
like
three and play with the scale and
position until I get something nice and
random okay now once it's done I can
take the very basic bird we've been
making and blend these random circles on
top of it in subtract
mode and now we can adjust and fine-tune
things for example I could play with the
tile generator random
seed now it still feels a bit too
uniform and to be honest it just reminds
me of a basketball a quick fix for that
would be to throw a warp somewhere in
here to just break that perfect round
shape uh so let's just grab a
warp grab a pearing noise as well and
experiment with them a
bit Twix the
scale and adjust the
intensity all
right now if I redirect it here like so
we have to keep in mind that it's going
to affect the edge detector as well so
in this case it's fine but sometimes you
have to think ahead about where you want
a certain effect to
appear now let's twig the tile random
seed one last
time okay our stylized flower is now
finished and all that is left to do is
to combine it with our little setup here
and this time we can use a blend for
that so let's set it to Max because we
want to add of flour and voila one thing
bothers me though now that I look at it
and that's the fact that we can see the
blades behind the flower and I wish the
flower would just completely hide what's
behind there are different ways we can
fix this but the one I would like to
show you is by using the opacity input
of the blend so far we haven't really
used it but it can really take your work
in designer to the next level so you
better get used to it early on so the
first thing I will do is actually change
the blending mode and set it back to
copy copy is basically saying that the
foreground will completely take over the
background you can think of it as a
replace mode now our flower replaces the
blades but I'd like to be more precise
I'd like to tell the blend okay let the
flower take over the rest but only in a
certain area I don't want it to override
everything I just want it to happen in a
small portion what I could do is take
the flower itself and use it as a mask
but since the mask here and the input
here are exactly the same we can't see
any difference from when we were
blending in Max mode so in order for it
to work I would need to expand the mask
a little so that it floods these
interstices here and this is something
that is actually pretty easy to do if I
take a blur so blur HQ here HQ for high
quality and connect my flower to it I
now have these gradients on the edges
that I can scan so to say so I could use
a levels for that but since it's pretty
basic I'm going to use a smaller and
very handy node that is the threshold
node this node just picks a grayscale
value and turns white everything that is
above it and black everything that is
under it and so you can easily adjust
the effect with this
slider all right I now have a nice
inflated mask that I can use to drive
the blend here so let's just try it and
there you go you can really see how it's
cutting out the background where the
flower is and now I can just move it
around and The Mask will keep
following I can also adjust it by either
playing with the
blur or with the
threshold all right so in this video we
saw how you can create custom shapes by
warping them and by leveraging the nois
randomness we also went through a more
controlled and advanced process using
splines which let us achieve more
precise results and both of these
examples are great at showing how
working in designer is really a back and
forth process it's not linear it's all
about building a small setup then
testing it then going back to the
previous noes making a few changes and
seeing how it impacts your final result
so it may look like a lot of work but
it's definitely worth it when you want
to have something that is dynamic and
customizable in the next video we will
see how you can import readymade images
if you want to skip that procedural
phase
