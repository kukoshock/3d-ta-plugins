it is now time to add the radial
ornaments that run along the trim so in
this video we will see how we can create
various gemstones and put them together
in this nice star shape that we have
here if we look at our graph we see that
it has become quite populated we have
the thread The Weave the ornaments the
trim elements and all of that comes
together in this main pipe that runs in
the middle and that makes up the height
of a material all right let's get on
with the gemstones I'm going to take
that space here for that and now let's
do one element at a time we have this
bead in the center and we could start
from there and use it as a sort of guide
for the rest I'm just going to take a
bell shape for that and you will soon
understand why I'm choosing such a soft
and fuzzy
shape let's move it downwards using the
offset slider to make sure we stay right
in the
center all right then we have this diam
shapes it would be interesting to see
how you would approach it based on the
knowledge you gathered in the previous
videos
what I like personally about this shape
is that there are different ways to make
it and they are all perfectly valid I'm
going to show you a few of them the
first that comes to mind for me is
taking a solid
Square rotating it
45° then squeezing it with a
transform okay and when I do that the
shape is repeating on both sides and I
don't want that so do you remember how
we can fix this we go to the base
parameters of the node switch the tiling
inheritance to Absol abolute then select
none so we now have a diamond shape but
it's completely flat just pure white
we're missing this nice bevel you see
here on the gemstones but if I search
for bevel well I have a note that does
just that so let's connect this and we
have a bunch of options to play with but
we're not going to worry too much about
them the most important parameter is
this slider at the top it controls the
strength of the bevel and you can decide
to Bevel inwards or out outwards I'm
going to Bevel inwards because it works
best with pointy end like that okay so
minus 2 okay so that was one way of
creating this diamond shape but you
could do it differently and that's what
I love about substance designer let me
show you how we can keep these two steps
so I'm just going to duplicate them but
instead of going for a flat Square this
time we're going to choose the pyramid
shape and you see that the pyramid is
just a beveled Square now the the
problem is that it's fully beveled and
so we have this point at the top which
we don't want but we could easily
flatten it using well levels so you just
crush the white and that's it or third
option instead of using the well-known
shape node we could use the polygon node
which lets you create and customize
polygons can choose how many sides it
has so let's go four four then rotate it
and what's cool with this note is that
it comes with some some sort of scan
slider built in so we can decide how
much slope we
want and there you have it three
different ways to achieve the same
result now let me get rid of all that so
now we need to repeat this gemstone in a
circle we already saw what node can help
us with that if we type in circular we
have the splatter circular let's plug
our shape switch to image
input and now it's time to think about
how to achieve this kind of
design but first off let's set the
amount right now we have 10 but we don't
need as many so let's go for six then
let's scroll down to the position tab
and we have two important sliders here
the
radius and the spread this one is very
useful because we only want a half
circle right so if one is full circle
then 0.5 should fix that problem there
we go next up we have the size let's
scale these diamonds up quite a lot I'm
going to go with
4.5 we could even play with the
non-uniform scaling I think I will
elongate them a little with 0.15 on the
Y maybe now by playing with the spread
slider we end it up with this rotation
that we don't want and you could of
course fix that manually with the
transform you know just doing it this
way after the fact but generally
speaking it's good practice to first
check if you have an option to do that
in the node itself
and if you have a look at the different
parameters of the splatter well it looks
like we have everything we need so let's
first fix the rotation we want to rotate
the ring and not the
pattern perfect and I'd also like to
move it downwards so in the position tab
I should have here we go this Global
offset
okay now let's place the last row of
gemstones the one that go in between
here we first need to make the shape
itself and you see that here it's not a
simple square but an actual polygon so
let's call for a polygon node polygon 2
let's keep the default hexagon maybe
rescale it a little then most
importantly flatten the top with the
gradient
slider then we have to go through the
whole splatter process again so to save
time I'm actually going to duplicate
this one and fix a few things and to see
better how they both fit together I'm
going to use that blend trick again you
remember when I just compare things by
lowering the
opacity okay let's first scale the gems
down to see things
better and so what we want is to place
each of these gems in that space here
between the diamonds and we have 1 2 3
four five of them so we need five
gemstones let's increase the
radius and there you see that the
spreading is off so we need to tighten
it a little now it can be hard to play
with very small increments like this so
if you hold shift it will actually slow
down the scrub in speed and it's much
easier this way so something like 42 all
right we now have the three parts of our
ornament all we need is to combine them
I'm going to keep that blend here and
switch it to Max reset the
opacity and then do the same for the
central sphere
okay now you see we have a problem here
the sphere appears too large but also
its grayscale values are not really
working well like the edges here look
like they are under the other gemstones
and that's not what we want now take a
moment to think about the different
solutions we could come up with the way
I see it we should darken that middle
area here to let the bead stick out more
there's a reason why I chose a bell
shape in the first place because it has
a very soft gradient it will be perfect
in subtract mode let me show you I'm
going to change the blending mode to
subtract and you see that it has cleared
this area meaning I can now do another
blend this time in Max
mode and you see that the subtract
definitely helped but we're not quite
there yet we still have overlap issues
and we can fix this easily with a simple
levels pushing the low values and
Shifting the gamma to have a flat L
surface all right all the elements of
our ornaments are in place there's only
one thing missing and that's the
mounting that goes around each Gem and
to do that we're going to rely on the
edge detect note I'm first going to deal
with these part because I want a
different mounting for the beads so
let's keep them separate now if we plug
this into an edge detect you see that
well we get something interesting but
not really what we want we just want the
outline of the stones and the reason why
the edge detect is giving us this result
is because it detects the gray scale
variations and so it reads the input and
assigns a border to each area for
example here is not the same as here and
so it puts an edge in between so if we
wanted to extract only the silhouette of
the shape all we would have to do is to
get rid of these inner variations and we
can do that easily by adding a threshold
node before the edge detect there we go
we can now play with the threshold
slider to offset the outline which is
very handy all right let's invert The
Edge detect thicken it a little and we
need to refine this shade because right
now it's all flat so to help with that
I'm just going to add a
blur and
levels okay now let's do the same for
the
Bell here I'm going to take the original
one to have more slope to play with so
to say
so
threshold Edge detect blur and
levels okay now let's combine all this
I'm going to add this to my bead in Max
mode maybe adjust it a
little okay then blend it with the
rest then finally add the other
mountings
perfect now you see that we have some
parts sticking out here it's not a big
problem we can adjust the whole thing
with
levels you see like
so okay when I'm ready to place this and
add it to our height we need a transform
for that let's divide it 1 2 3 four
maybe switch to horizontal tiling so
that we have only one line and and
rotate and to place it let's first blend
it with the main
connection Max
mode all
right let's maybe move it a
little okay now it's finally time to see
how it looks in 3D so let's reroot
everything now the resolution is
definitely a limitation here but we can
already start to make a few adjustments
for examp example I think the top gems
are too small so let's go back to fix
this play with the
levels tweak some of the
thresholds like
so okay let's also check the result in
4k because it needs to work at both
resolutions okay I think I'm pretty
happy with it
and this wraps up our video on ornament
creation we learned how to create
gemstones and how to assemble them using
Advanced nodes like the splatter
circular our height is now mostly done
so in the next video we will see how we
can extract useful masks from it in
order to tackle the color and the
roughness
