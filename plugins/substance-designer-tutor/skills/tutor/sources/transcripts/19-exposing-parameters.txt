when you reach the end of the creation
process in substance designer most of
the times you want to export your work
in order to use it in other apps and by
exporting I don't mean just saving the
outputs I mean leveraging the power of
the procedural graph you just built by
making some of its parameters editable
outside of substance designer this
process is called exposing and in this
video I'm going to teach you all there
is to know about it the reason why it's
so important is because you don't want
to be stuck in designer designer is just
a tool in your pipeline and you need to
be able to quickly take a material out
of it while keeping the ability to
interact with it it sounds a little bit
like magic when you put it that way
after all when you create something in
other node Bas interfaces like blender
or unreal your work usually remains
there and can be taken out to other apps
so how does substance designer overcomes
that the answer is substance archive or
SBS you can think of a substance archive
as a sort of compressed version of your
substance package remember the package
is this box here where the graphs and
everything related to our project live
so when you're done with your material
instead of just exporting the outputs
you can publish it as one single file
one substance archive which will give
you the ability to interact with it
outside of designer But first you need
to decide which parameters you want to
interact with in other words you need to
expose them so let's do it together but
this is where being methodical and
organized in your work really helps
because now I can easily read the
structure of my material and spot the
pivotal notes that would be interesting
to expose let's start with the beginning
of the graph I'm going to assume that
this material will be used by other
people that don't necessarily know how I
build it or maybe don't know about
substance designer so it needs to be
simple and intuitive really focusing on
the key parameters and not overwhelming
the final user with dozens of micro
parameters that don't make a big
difference for that reason I don't think
we should expose anything in the weave
structure itself we found a good balance
here and I don't want the final user to
break anything what I would like to
expose though is the ornament mask that
drives the second weave this is
something that has a strong visual
impact and it's easy to change we
already have two ornaments coming from
our subgraph here all we need now is a
way to toggle them there is a note
dedicated to that it's the switch node
this node is basically a big button that
returns one one of two inputs so it's
super simple to use and really the best
Noe when you want to choose between two
things the problem is that like I said
it only takes two inputs and I would
actually like to add one more ornament
to the mix no worries the switch node
has a big brother with more options the
multi
switch it works the same way but instead
of a single button you get a slider that
lets you cycle through different
inputs and now let's talk about this
this third option that I wanted to add
I'm not going to add it here like I'm
not going to create another ornament or
import another image instead I would
like to give that option to the final
users so that they can input whatever
they want so what we need here is to
open a little window so to say that will
let them add their own information even
though they won't have access to the
graph itself and the way we do that is
by adding an input
node so input great scale there we go
this node is empty because it just acts
as a vessel for whatever image will be
loaded in it so of course it doesn't
have any specific parameters but it has
some attributes that will help identify
it so let's call it custom ornament
here and
here now here we need to put ourselves
in the final users shoes assuming he
doesn't know much about how a graph is
built maybe he will try to input a color
image or maybe something with gradients
that just wouldn't work and to prevent
that we can give him a Little Help by
filling out the description box so I
would just clarify things here say that
it acts as a mask the image needs to be
square and black and white all right now
let's get back to our multi switch node
connect it and we can finally start to
expose some parameters in the case of
the multi switch the only thing the user
needs to have access to is the input
selection how can we expose this well
it's very simple just click on that
little icon here next to the parameter
and select expose as new graph input it
will then open up a window where you can
customize the behavior of this new
Option we're not going to touch the
identifier here but we should give the
label a sensible name like ornament
type by default the multi switch comes
with sliders and I don't know but I
don't find it very convenient to select
things I can change that here where it
says type editor and go for a nice drop
down menu what we can now do is give
each input a name so we know that input
one is our flowers so let's call it
floral then we click on the little plus
button here input two geometri
call and input three will be
custom all right then click okay now
you'll notice that our initial slider
has disappeared from the multi switch
parameters instead we just have the name
highlighted in blue and it looks like we
can't interact with it anymore don't
worry that's perfectly normal when you
expose a parameter it gets promoted to
the graph level meaning it now belongs
to the graph and not the node so to
access it all you need to do is double
click anywhere in the
background and you will find it here in
the input
parameters and you see if I expand it
here are my options I can always change
them afterwards like give the inputs
different names change the type of
editor it's all up to you so notice that
we have three tabs here parameters
preview and presets we'll go over the
presets later but the preview tab is
important because it shows you how
things will look to the final user you
can think of it as the front end of your
material so this for example is how our
multi switch will appear we have this
nice drop down menu and we can test it
making sure everything works
properly all right what is nice about
this preview state is that it doesn't
affect your graph you can always revert
back to the default settings and as soon
as you leave the tab you go back to your
normal editing all right before we move
on to the other parameters I would like
to quickly show you how it looks in
another app such as substance Stager I
will explain how to send the material
there in the next video but for now let
me just show you how it looks here I'm
just using another cloth meesh to
display our Fabric and you see that in
the material tab we have substance and
our onet fabric is here we can change it
resolution and below that we have our
exposed parameters so we can change the
ornament just as expected and switch to
custom then we can use that little
window that we opened by adding an input
and you see that I can now load any
image for example let me grab this
one and there we go everything works
that's perfect I can switch back to
Floral
geometrical
awesome now there's one thing that
bothers me it's the fact that the custom
input slot is displayed even when we are
using the default ornaments ideally I
would like it to appear only when the
user selects custom in the drop- down
menu but let's get back to our graph to
fix this what we're going to do is we're
going to select our custom input here
and you see that towards the bottom we
have this condition tab with a visible
if field what this does is that it let
us write a logical expression see the
input will be visible if the condition
is verified in other words we can give
designer an instruction that would go
something like show this only if this is
true we have to write it following
certain conventions that you can find in
this page of the documentation that I'm
linking here so this is how you should
write it so visible if if the input so
here it's the
identifier equals
3 okay now let's check if it
works and yep the custom input only
appears when we choose custom in the
list
perfect so in this video we learned how
to expose a parameter and we even went
further than that by creating a custom
input that will allow the future users
to load their own masks in the next
video we will continue this work by
exposing parameters that can be a little
bit more tricky like the color and we
will try to find a way to control both
the trim and the gemstones with just one
button I see you in a bit
