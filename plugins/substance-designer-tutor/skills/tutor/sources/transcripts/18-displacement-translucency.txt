before we wrap up this fabric material
I'd like to add two more things to make
it a bit more interesting one of them is
displacement now we've touched upon this
in the beginning of this course when I
told you that height could mean
different things in the broadest sense
the height map is just that grayscale
image we've been building for most of
the episodes and that feeds into the
normal node so what we see on our model
right now is not the height but just the
normal map but when it comes to
displaying the height itself what we
actually mean by that is displacement
now displacement is a heavy process
because it relies on subdivision of the
geometry so for that reason I usually
turn it off unless I really need it and
materials like fabric are mostly flat
anyway so I knew we wouldn't need it
until we reach the very end now let me
show you what our displacement looks
like if we turn it back on and remember
right now it's taking in the Raw height
map that we built
here okay so material default edit and
hide designer actually went back to it
display settings with a little bit of
displacement you can see it if we look
at it at very low angles we had this
sort of bumpiness on the edge here and
to see it better we need to crank up the
Desolation otherwise designer will not
have enough geometry to displace that's
one very common mistake that beginners
do often when they try to increase the
displacement and nothing happens that's
because they forgot to tesate the mesh
so let's type in a large number like
50 and push the scale to
10 okay there are a few things that I'd
like to show you here first you see that
we get this sort of spikes here around
the edges that's due to the
Desolation see if I move the
slider now you might be thinking okay
then we just need to increase the
Desolation until it's all nice and
smooth but the thing is you will end up
with a crazy geometry that will make
everything extremely slow without fixing
all the artifacts so it's not the
smartest way around this and I'd like to
draw your attention to another problem
see if I look at the weave well it
appears that even the threads are
getting displaced which is way too much
the only thing that is worth displacing
here are the trim and the gemstones
these are the bits that should really
stick out the rest can remain flat and
rely on normal information only it means
that to get a good displacement map we
need to create it separately and we can
do that easily by just reusing different
bits from our graph okay since we are
want to displace the trim and ornaments
I'm going to take a
DOT and start from this mask here
everything else is black meaning flat
which is exactly what we want one other
way we can avoid these spikes and
artifacts that I mentioned and that you
often get when you use displacement is
by simply blurring a little the input to
avoid hard edges let's take a
blur and set it to
0.2 just to have a bit of slope here
okay that's already much better the only
problem is that it makes everything a
little Blobby and the gemstones in
particular don't stand out enough you
can try to find your own solution to
this what I'm going to do is simply
lower this with a level then do a
blend and add the gemstones mask on
top like that
okay you might argue that even though
it's a little bit better we still have
Jagged outlines and artifact and this is
due to the resolution if we check how it
looks in
4k well all of a sudden everything
becomes nice and sharp so it's a balance
to find between details and
efficiency in any case we now have a
good displacement map all right the
second property I wanted to mention is
translucency right now the gemstones
look like they are made out of plastic
or some sort of opaque material which is
not exactly the look I was after and
translucency looks like the answer to
this problem but if I go to the base
material Maps you see that we don't have
any translucency slots and so I wanted
to walk you through this situation where
you work in a template that is made for
certain Maps but then you realize that
you need something more that is not in
the template in our case translucency
now the good news is that it's not
really a problem because designer lets
you play with as many channels As You
Wish no matter what template you chose
in the
beginning and you see that if I were to
take any Noe right click and drag it
into the viewport I would get to choose
between all these different channels
including channels that I don't have in
my base material like mive coating
anisotropy and so on now the thing is I
don't want to just display a new channel
in the 3D view I want it to be a part of
my material something that will be
packed and exported with it at the end
so the way we can do it is very simple
you see we have all these final outputs
After Base material the color the normal
the roughness and so on and all we have
to do is to create just one more output
so let's type in
output here we go and now we're going to
replicate that structure we see on the
other output so identifier label group
and usage okay so identifier let's call
it
translucency same for
label group it's important that we place
it under the material umbrella just like
the rest and finally usage this is going
to tell designer how to use that
information we're going to plug in there
so here all we have to do is to scroll
down until we find translucency
here and that's it now of course we need
to plug something in there translucency
Maps work a little like metallic Maps
they are basically masks that tell the
Shader what is translucent and what is
not so in our case since we only want
the gemstones to be translucent it's
going to be very easy just take a DOT
grab the gemstone mask and connect it to
your output and that's it translucency
usually need a bit more information to
work properly like the absorption color
and distance but I'd rather deal with
that directly in the final rendering app
than create Maps just for this in
designer it's up to you but I just find
it a bit more flexible and with that
said we can finally call this material
done however like I said in the
introduction what makes parametric
materials special is that they are not a
static collection of maps but a dynamic
system that you can interact with even
after closing designer so in the next
video we will see how we can expose some
of these parameters to the final user so
that he doesn't end up with just the
current green fabric but also with the
power to change it however it
liks for
