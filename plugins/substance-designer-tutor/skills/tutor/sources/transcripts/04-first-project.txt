all right we're now ready to go in this
video we will see how to create and set
up a new substance designer project as
well as a few tips and tricks to quickly
get you started so let's open up
designer and on the top left corner
we're going to click on new substance
graph we are presented with this window
and the first thing it asks us is to
name that new graph that we are creating
I'm going to call this one ONN it fabric
you don't have to worry too much about
the information below the default
settings are fine in most cases and
these properties can all be changed
later on see you can change these values
at any time the 2048 resolution is also
a good starting point so let's just
leave it as is below are the template
information they are directly referring
to the template that is selected on the
left in this case it's the default PBR
metallic roughness template what this
means is that if you choose this
Template Designer will automatically set
up output notes for each of these
channels for the sake of this tutorial
we'll set our template to empty so that
we can start from scratch then simply
press
okay and here we go we now have this
beautiful blank canvas to start working
from exciting don't you think now before
we begin let's just have a look at our
File Explorer on the left as you can see
our graph is here with the name we gave
it and it sits within a substance
package that is yet unnamed and unsaved
so let's do that first select the
package and click on the save icon now
everything we will add to this project
be resources other graphs 3D meshes Etc
it will all be stored in that package so
let's just go back to our graph by
double clicking it all right here we are
in the middle of our main working space
it is completely empty so now it's
finally the time to start building
things you may have noticed that our
graph comes with a little warning sign
in the file explorer if we hover over it
it displays the same message as the one
at the bottom here saying that we have
no output it's fine and you can totally
start working without them but setting
up outputs can be useful to preview or
work in the 3D view right now if I add
any node for example a uniform color
node I can only see it as a 2D image
here in my 2D view while my default Cube
remains gray so one of the first things
we will need is a setup that allows us
to preview in that preview the
information we manipulate there are
different ways to do this for example if
I right click my node and drag it all
the way down to the 3D View and let go
designer will ask me which channel it
belongs to there's a bunch of them as
you can see if I choose base color now
my color node is reflected both in the
2D View and in the 3D view this is one
way of doing it but it can be tedious to
repeat this step each time for each
Channel instead we will go for a simpler
method and add a note that will pack all
the channels we need for us and generate
corresponding outputs so how can we do
that now would be a good time to learn
learn how to add nodes in our working
space you actually saw me doing it just
a moment ago I went over to the toolbar
at the top grabbed one of these and
placed it in the graph this colorful row
that you see right here contains what we
call the atomic nodes they are the
fundamental bricks of substance designer
all the other nodes are made with a
combination of these and they cannot be
broken down into smaller elements this
toolbar is very handy but we won't find
all the nodes available here for that we
need to go to the library if I need for
example a noise or a grung map I can
come over to the texture category to see
what I have and just grab whatever note
I find interesting now these two methods
are especially useful in the beginning
when you first start exploring substance
designer they will help you grasp the
different tools as well as their
underlying logic so I really encourage
you to just navigate the library and try
out random notes also don't forget that
you can find tool tips pretty much
everywhere in designer so if you're not
sure what a note does just hover over it
to find out all right let's just get rid
of these by dragging a selection around
them and pressing delete there is one
more way to add nodes that I haven't
talked about and this is how we'll be
adding nodes most of the times
throughout this course make sure your
graph is active by clicking anywhere in
the working space then press space bar
or tab this will open up a quick search
where you can type in anything by
default it will display the atomic node
the same as here but as soon as you
start typing in something like let's say
blur for example it will filter out all
the blurring nodes available so we not
only have the atomic blur but also
several other nodes like slow blur
radial blur non-uniform blur Etc using
this quick search is also a great way to
discover new nodes you can't know the
whole Library by heart I certainly don't
yet I've been using designer for years
now so when I'm looking for a certain
effect but don't know if there is a Noe
for that I just type and approach name
in the quick search so these were three
ways of adding nodes in your graph
grabbing them from the toolbar from the
library or searching for them in the
quick search most of the times we'll
just use that last method now let's look
for the first note to add to our current
project I'm going to press space bar and
type in
base here we want to bring in the base
material note it may seem
counterintuitive but this note that we
are adding first is actually going to be
the very last of our graph and it's
going to sit at the very right of a node
Arrangement the reason for that is that
we want to use it as a mean to quickly
and easily preview our work so
everything we're going to build will
converge towards it to be displayed in
the 3D view since it's a material node
it contain all the different channels we
need so we won't have to create
individual outputs for each of them and
we'll have everything neatly packed in
one Noe which I find easier to handle
now do you remember how we can dis
display a node in the 3D view we right
click it and drag and drop it in the 3D
view this time no need to assign
anything the node does it for us
alternatively we could right click it
and select view in 3D view now what we
are seeing in our 3D view is the result
of this material node we added so if we
change anything in its parameters it
will update in real time which is
exactly what we wanted let's just take a
moment to go over the parameter
remember that this panel on the right is
context sensitive so it will display the
properties of the element that is
currently active at the top we have the
base parameters that are common to all
the nodes and that we won't touch for
now then we have the attributes we don't
need to look into those right now so you
can just collapse them and finally the
instance parameters that are specific to
this node now if we scroll down a little
we can see that we have options and
Sliders corresponding to each map first
we have the color it's set to gray by
default which is actually perfect for a
start as we don't want to be distracted
with bright Hues in the beginning next
up is the metallic slider you may have
noticed that as soon as we dropped our
material in the 3D view it turned the
cube metallic and that's because the
metallic map is set to White which means
fully metallic so let's just turn it off
completely for now the roughness is fine
maybe a tad too smooth so let's just
increase it a little by pushing the
slider to the right again these early
adjustments are just meant to get us
started we will change them later on
during this course now if we keep
scrolling down we have this userdefined
map section at the bottom what this
means is that for each Channel we can
decide if we want it to be driven by one
of the built-in sliders like the one we
just tweaked or by a custom map that we
could plug into the node so for example
if I activate the base color by setting
it to True an input automatically pops
up on the left letting me plug a custom
image here the yellow dot indicates that
it's expecting a color input so let's
just grab a uniform color node like so
or we could just type in color in the
search bar and now let's make our first
connection shall we to do so just click
once on the output and let go you don't
have to hold just release your click and
the connection will follow you can now
pan holding your middle Mouse button
while keeping the connection attached
and now let's just connect it by
clicking once more on the input taada
congratulations you just connected two
nodes you see that the color of a base
material node is now driven by this node
and that our original color palette has
disappeared now we said earlier that we
don't want a bright color to begin with
so let's just delete this and deactivate
the base color Once More by setting it
to four if you followed the First videos
of this series you know that we usually
start by building the height of a
material before tackling its color or
roughness so which Maps should we enable
here you may be tempted to say well the
height map obviously but we'll actually
let this one turned off at first the
reason for that is that the height
channel in designer is used to drive the
displacement which is a heavy process
that we'll introduce a bit later so yes
we are going to build the height map but
we are going to preview it through two
other Maps the normal map and the amban
occlusion map let's just enable both of
these all right we're almost set and
ready to go there's one last step we
need to perform these two inputs we
enabled require specific data and we
can't Feit them grayscale information
directly so we need to bring two little
companion nodes to fix this let's start
with the normal you see that it's
expecting a color input if we look for
normal in our search bar we have a
normal node that computes a normal map
from a grayscale image which is ex
exactly what we need let's add it and
let's just increase its intensity to
three here in the specific
parameters as for the Aman occlusion it
will create Shadows based on height
information since the input is empty it
has turned the cube fully black but if
we search for occlusion we see that we
have two amban occlusion nodes I'm going
to go for the rt1 which is R traced
ambient occlusion it's the most accurate
but it's also a bit heavy so feel free
to use the Horizon based one instead
let's connect
it okay and so from now on any
information we create will be fed to
these two nodes that converge to a final
base material letting us see in real
time what our height looks
like all right let's recap what we just
saw in this video you now know how to
create a new substance graph remember
that the default settings are fine in
most cases and that you can always
change them later on your new graph will
be placed in a substance package that
contains everything related to your
project just don't forget to save it
when you start you also learned how to
add and connect your first nodes I see
you in the next video where we will
start working on the fabric itself
