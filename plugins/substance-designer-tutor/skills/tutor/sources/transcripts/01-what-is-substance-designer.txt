so what exactly is substance designer
well at its core it's a software that
generates textures when you work in
designer your end product is a
collection of bit Maps they can be
exported separately aesthetic images or
bundled in what we call a substance
archive packed together these textures
form a material that can be applied to
any 3D object but what makes substance
designer special is that the materials
created inside it are parametric you're
not only saving static bit Maps but also
the dynamic recipe to create them it
means that any feature can be changed
and adjusted later on through what we
call exposed parameters and these
parameters can be accessed not only in
designer but also in any application
that supports substance like Blend or
unreal for example another distinctive
feature of substance designer is that
unlike other applications that are layer
based like painter or sampler designer
works with nodes everything here is
created in a graph where you connect
nodes together to generate certain
effects like warping tiling blurring
multiplying and so on now all of this
can seem a little bit scary at first so
don't worry we're going to explain it
all in this series what's important to
understand is that this branching
structure is what makes material's
dynamic in designer a change to the
settings of one node will propagate to
all the nodes that are connected to it
allowing for a powerful non-destructive
workflow another question that often
gets asked is what's the difference
between sub designer and the other
substance apps like painter for example
while they have some features in common
their purposes are different designer is
very versatile but it's primarily a
material authoring tool it's meant to
create tileable base materials that can
be applied to various meshes whereas
painter is meant to generate effects on
specific meshes using generators and
brushes you can think of it as the
difference between a paint bucket and a
brush in designer you create the paint
and in painter use the brush to apply it
to specific areas of a model so to sum
up substance designer is a material
authoring software that uses procedural
operations to create Dynamic materials
and much more now let's move on to the
typical workflow that we follow when we
create materials in substance designer
