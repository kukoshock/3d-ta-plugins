okay we are now ready to take the thread
that we created in the previous video
and weave it into a complex fabric now
you'll notice that my three view looks
different from where we left off see my
thread is completely flat and that's
because I closed and reopened my project
and when you do that in designer the
viewport will just reverse back to its
default settings to access these
settings again you need to come over to
the material menu here go to default
edit and in the material properties find
the height section see in my case it's
set to the default one but if I push it
up I can see my displacement again now
at this stage of the project we don't
really need any displacement plus keep
in mind that it can also make things
slower so I'm just going to turn it off
completely also now that I'm looking at
my node arrangement I realized that I
forgot to connect that last node we
added so let's just replug it quickly by
clicking here while holding shift then
letting go over the new
output okay we're now good to go there's
just one last thing I'd like to do
before we continue and that is
organizing our graph a little even if it
looks simple things can quickly get out
of hand and if you don't pay attention
you can end up with one of those
spaghetti fests that you may have seen
on the internet and we don't want that
Designer ships with tools to help you
keep things neat and tidy you will find
them in the toolbar here at the top we
can for example add commands to a graph
which is pretty useful if you want to
guide either a different user or future
yourself then we have the dot nod we'll
talk about this one later and we have
the frame tool now the way it works is
that you select the nodes you want a
group then you click on the frame icon
and boom all your nodes now belong to
that frame and you can move them around
like so you can of course rename your
frame I'm going to call this one base
rad and you can change it color which is
quite important because it means you can
color code your graph I personally tend
to use specific spefic colors for
specific parts for example I always use
gray frames for grayscale maps like the
roughness of the metallic and bright
Violet for the normal and so on and with
that logic in mind I can read any of my
graphs at first glance which is very
handy now for this project feel free to
choose whatever color you want uh I'm
going to stick with the default blue
what matters is that we have that first
group of nodes bundled in one box we'll
try to do it for every logical step of
our process so you can try to guess
ahead when it makes sense to add a frame
and when it doesn't all right when I
ready to turn this individual bit of
thread into a fully woven fabric it
sounds a bit intimidating when you put
it that way but uh remember again you
can always break down complex structures
into simple elements so when we look at
any kind of weave what we see is
actually a repetition of the same
element over and over again and to be
more specific we have two repetitions
going on in a fabric we have the warp
that is the threads that go vertically
and the weft that is the threads that go
horizontally and we can just tackle one
at a time so let's start with the WID it
should be easier because our thread is
already in the right position and all we
need is find a way to repeat it or in
designer lingual to tile it so let's
just type tile in our quick search and
see what we got so we have these orbs at
the top of the list they're just
readymade materials that you can use
when you don't want to create something
from scratch so let's just skip those
and below are the tile nodes we're
looking for we have tile generator TI
random tile sampler and each of them is
available both in Gray scale and color
and here again you might wonder how do I
know which one to pick and the answer is
you don't not in the beginning anyway so
the key here is really to experiment and
play around with the notes you encounter
also read that descriptions for example
in this case we know that tire random is
probably not what we're looking for it
leaves us with tile generator and tile
sampler both are very similar but the
tile sampler is a bit more advanced so
we'll deal with it later for now let's
just bring in a tile generator
grayscale okay as you can see it looks
pretty harmless with just these two
inputs we have a pattern input and a
background input and we won't use that
one much the pattern input is expecting
the element that you want to tile so in
our case it's it's the thread so let's
just plug it there all right let's talk
about the properties first because as
you can see this node has lots of them
and it can be a little overwhelming at
first so I'm just going to collapse all
the different
sections so that we can tackle them one
by one so at the top of the list we have
the X and Y sliders that let us choose
how much we want the pattern to be
repeated in both axes they are clamped
to 64 by default but as you now know we
can always dial in any number we want
for now let's just keep them at 64 next
is the pattern section this one is
important because as you can see even if
we plugged our thread in the pattern
input here it still doesn't show in the
2D View and that's because the pattern
here is set to the default brick so we
need to change it to image
input there you go we can leave the rest
as is so let's scroll down to the size
section this one is a bit more tricky to
navigate because you have all these
options we have middle size interstice
you can skip those at first and focus on
the scale because it's the most familiar
it just resizes the pattern uniformly
like that now you see that as I make my
threads bigger they start to overlap and
it's giving me these weird bright
intersections that can be annoying
that's because by default the tile
generator Blends patterns in ad mode if
you want to change that you need to come
over to the color section and change the
blending mode to
Max all right now the repetition we have
right here is still missing something
all the threads are perfectly aligned
and this is not how Fabrics work so what
I would like is to offset them and I can
do this by going to the position section
here where I have this offset slider now
I could eyeball it like that or if I
want a perfect offset I can just type in
0.5 okay it looks better now but we
still have the problem of these big gaps
between each row ideally I would like
this tining to be very tight and dense
and you can see that I can't really get
there with the size parameters only so
this is where you need to balance the
effects between different parameters in
our case we will need to play with both
the number of repetitions here and the
scale here so let's jump back to the X
and Y amount what I'm going to do is
first I'm going to break that 64 limit
by typing in a large number like 200 for
example and you see that when I do that
it also expands the slightest range
accordingly now what I want is to add
more threads on the vertical axis which
is the Y AIS so let's just push that
slider until there are almost no gaps
left I think somewhere around 800 is
fine I may also take the X down a little
to I don't know 120 for example now you
see that because I increased the tiling
on one axis and not on the other it has
distorted the threads and it also made
them much smaller and darker that's why
we need to go back to the size
parameters and make a few changes so
first I'm going to drastically increase
the scale set it to five then to get the
shape of the thread back I can simply
play with the X and Y
interstices like so all right we are
almost there for the WFT but now that I
look at it I feel like the results we
have here is a bit too uniform so I'm
going to break that uniformity by first
decreasing the offset so that we have a
more Dynamic
structure see like so then you see that
in almost all the sections we have an
option to
randomize you can get crazy with it but
in our case we want to add just a pinch
of Randomness to make things look more
natural and realistic the f free to
experiment with it just keep in mind
that usually you need to aim at very low
values like 01 02 something like
that all right it took us some time but
we made the first half of our fabric now
it's time to tackle the war so the
threads that go vertically we could
reuse the same technique creating
another tile generator and just rotating
the threads but instead I'd like to show
you another approach in the search bar
let's type in directional and choose one
of the directional noises I'm going to
go with that light one here directional
noise 3 if you zoom on it a bit you will
see that it looks a little like wood
fibers right with these thin strips
going all in the same direction that's
exactly what I want we have a few
parameters to play with and the first
thing I want to change is the rotation
because remember it needs to go
vertically for warp so let's just type
in 90° and I'd also like to scale it up
let's say up to three okay so it doesn't
really look like fabric yet but with a
few adjustments we can make it work so
one thing stands out in particular when
I zoom out you see we have these large
luminance variations like this Light
patch here these darker areas here and I
just know by looking at it that it's
going to make our height look very
grungy and not very textile like so I
need to somehow remove these large
variations while keeping the details
sharp and to achieve this we will use a
very handy node that is the high pass
gray
scale this node is great at removing
large scale variations see when I
compare the two these big blotches are
completely gone and we can push the
effect even further by reducing the high
pass radius to I don't know
0.2 okay so we got rid of the main
discrepancy but we also lost some
contrast in the process to get it back
I'm going to use the sharpen node so
let's just bring it in and there you go
see how it makes the edges pop out let's
just soften it a little maybe somewhere
around 6 perfect and you see with just
two notes we went from this sort of
lumpy directional noise to something
nice and flat with the highpass Yet full
of detail
thanks to the
sharpen this will act as our warp so we
now have the two halves of our fabric
with our warp here and a w here and all
that is left to do is to bring them
together and for that we will use of
course a
blend so let's take our warp first and
hook it to the background then take our
W and connect it to the
foreground now we need to think about
the blending mode because right now
we're in copy mode so that means means
the WFT here just overrides everything
what we want is for the warp to show up
in the darker areas of the WFT in other
words when the W threads sink in we want
the warp threads to come out there is a
blending mode that would be perfect for
that and that is the max mode you may
know it as lighten this mode essentially
compares the two inputs and keeps the
lighter values but for some reason we
still don't see a warp can you guess why
just look at the two images we're
blending again we are telling the blend
to display all the pixels in this image
that are lighter than this image but you
see that there are no such pixels our
weft is just too dark and the warp is
just too bright so how do you think we
can fix this take a moment to think
about it the solution is to modify the
grayscale values of one of these two
using levels for example we could either
darken the wart or lighten the WFT I'm
going to go with with that first option
now I could just go on the side here add
my levels then reconnect everything but
what I can also do is select the
connection so that it's highlighted like
that then press space bar and select the
levels here and if I do that it will
automatically add the levels to the
connection so I don't need to replug
anything alternatively if I want to
remove a node there's two ways I can do
it I can simply select it and press
delete but if I do that it will also
break the connection or I can press
backspace and it will just remove the
node while keeping the connection pretty
handy now I can adjust the levels to
make the warp darker and to see more
clearly the effect of what I'm doing I'm
going to double click the blend itself
to preview it in the 2D view while
playing with the
levels in this case I'm not interested
in remapping the input values I just
want to uniformly darken the whole image
so I can just take the out Arrow here
here and decrease the lightness like so
and you see that as I bring down the
light values of the warp the weft starts
to appear now at this point it's hard to
tell if what we did looks good in 3D or
not so let's reconnect everything by
left clicking while holding shift and
redocking
here okay wow it's definitely making a
difference but it's so dark and noisy
that it's hard to tell and the reason
why it's so dark has to to do with how
our ambient occlusion Works remember the
ENT occlusion is that node we added at
the very beginning with the normal and
it's role is basically to create shadows
in the hollows and Cavities of our
material and you see that it's now
mostly black Fabrics tend to darken
easily because the threads are so tiny
so let's just go in the properties of
the ambient occlusion and they decrease
the height to a very low value like
0.01 much better
all right there's one last note I'd like
to add to wrap up this base fabric when
I look at the result in the 3D view I
realize that the scale is still a bit
off it's a bit too large actually for
what I have in mind so I'm going to add
a transform 2D and divide the whole
thing by
two perfect we'll discuss the question
of the scale in the next episodes but
for now let's call this one done and the
best way to do it is to to frame or work
remember so let me select the nodes
click on frame and let's call this one
base
weave so in this video we saw how you
can tile an element using the tile
generator and how you can play with both
the amount and the scale to build
something very specific we also saw how
we can refine a noise by using tools
like the highpass and the
sharpen in the next video we'll see how
we can create all oraments procedurally
to add them to our weave
