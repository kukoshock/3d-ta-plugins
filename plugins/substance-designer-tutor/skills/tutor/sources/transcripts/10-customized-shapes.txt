with our fabric mostly done we can focus
on the trim and start to plan things out
and so in this episode we will see how
we can create custom shapes like sequins
Loops seams and so on now you might be
thinking wait a minute our fabric is not
done it's all flat and gray and we can
barely see the ornaments that's true but
remember that at this stage of the
project we're still working on the
height and we won't be dealing with the
collor or the roughness until it's done
so we first need to finish this properly
and right now it means tackling the trim
now there's a lot going on here and it
may feel a bit overwhelming like how am
I going to make all this and the key
here again is to break it down into its
different parts so we have one two three
four rows and each row is just made out
of a few elements so the Hem here for
example is just a series of threads then
we have a sequin then a loop then these
radial ornaments which in turn can be
broken down into one two three gemstones
you get the idea one way we could
approach this is by creating each
individual piece first and the idea is
really to focus on small simple tasks
and not letting ourselves get distracted
or discouraged by the broader picture so
let's get on with it I'm going to take
that space here above our main
connection and start assembling the
different elements we need the first
element is that seam here and to get
this look we could simply take a thread
and tile it vertically we already have
one that we can reuse so let me just
grab that output and I don't know
exactly how I'm going to do it yet but I
would still like to keep that connection
around just to have it close at hand
what I could do is pin it using a DOT
note it's a small tool that helps
keeping your graph clean by re rooting
connections there are different ways you
can add it you could simply click on it
and dock your connection it also works
with the quick search just by typing it
dot but that's a simpler way if you
press alt while hovering over a
connection
you see that we have this yellow dot
that follows my cursor and if I click it
just adds it automatically and now I can
move it around to reorganize things if I
click on it and hold alt again I can
also group the connections that share
the same origin very useful and to
remove a DOT you just press backspace
like any other Noe you can do more with
a DOT node but let's skip that for later
right now all I want is to pin the
output of the thread somewhere up here
because this is I'm going to create all
the trim elements so with the connection
still attached to my cursor I'm just
going to hit alt and there we go all
right I don't think we need to tweak
This Thread too much um I will maybe
narrow it a little with a transform
2D holding control to resize from the
middle and that's it now what do we have
next let's take a look at the reference
okay we have this row of sequence that's
actually a good exercise if you've been
following this course so far you should
should be able to make one sequin by
yourself so pause the video have a good
look at the reference and give it a try
all right let's do it together a sein is
basically just a small disc of plastic
so we can start with a shape and go for
dis this dis should have a hole in it to
let a thread through we can do that by
duplicating that first disc contrl D
making it
smaller and subtracting it from the
first dis
all right then we have this interesting
feature where the sequence gets slightly
tilted due to the overlap see this bit
is higher than this bit that's easy to
make we need to darken the Grays scale
value towards the bottom here and to do
that I'm going to take another blend put
the squin in the background and subtract
from it the part that I want to
lower I could use a shape for that and
place it with a transform 2D but this
actually better solution for this kind
of use case if you type in gradient you
see that we have this collection of
grayscale gradients we can pick from and
I'm going to go with gradient axal
because this one comes with handles that
just makes the placement
easier now let's put it into
place and voila we made ourselves a nice
sequin shape next up are these looped
threads now this is interesting because
it brings us to Circular operation in
substance designer there are a couple of
notes that let you revolve inputs or tie
them in circle there is for example the
splatter circular this one works like a
tile generator it takes a pattern and
repeats it but it does so in circles so
it comes with specific parameters for
you to play with like the radius the
amount of rings and so on very useful
note for ornaments we'll come back to it
later now if you want to bend an input
into a circle which is our okay there
are other options but let's just mention
the main one the shape
mapper this one works a little like a
splatter circular but if you reduce the
amount to one it will actually distort
the input like
so now to get the desired look we could
simply play with another
transform until we have something that
works all right so we have the thread
the sequin the loop and we should take a
moment to place and assemble all this
before we tackle the radial ornaments
let's start with the thread we need to
find a way to repeat it on one axis so
that we get some sort of line how could
we do that your first impulse might be
to use a tile generator or a tile
sampler and it could definitely work but
I would say it would maybe be an
Overkill we can get a good enough result
using only transform 2D let me show you
how we start by taking another transform
and rotating our thread 90° you can do
that using the handles remember holding
shift or simply by pressing that 90
button here now we could tile it right
now simply by hitting repeatedly this
divide by two button the problem is if
we do that it leaves us with these gaps
between each thread and it's not exactly
the kind of look we are aiming for we
want something that is tight so to fill
these gaps here's a knit trick we can do
we're going to take that thread and
offset it vertically by going to this x
slider here and typing in
0.5 you see that if I display the tiling
in the 2D view by pressing space bar and
now move the thread around it keeps
tiling perfectly and that's because we
apply the safe rotation to it if I were
to rotate it manually see the seam
instantly shows up all right let me undo
all that now we're going to take that
offset thread and hook it to a blend
then create a duplicate of it remove the
offset and put that in the foreground
this will just allow us to feel that Gap
I was mentioning if I change the
blending mode to Max see now I have a
nice continuous line of threads may even
be too uniform so I'm just going to Twig
the middle thread to make it more varied
keeping an eye on the tile view
always okay now let's Zoom back on our
texture and disable the tiling so at
this point we only have two and a half
threads in a one to one square it's
clearly not enough so it's time to
repeat all this let's add another
transform and start dividing this a
bunch of
time like
five six maybe okay but we have a
problem here the threads tile vertically
all right but they also tile
horizontally and we don't want that we
only want one line being able to control
how an image ties is critical in
substance designer and since styling is
part of the base parameters present in
each node we should make a quick detour
into this parameter and The Inheritance
system behind it
