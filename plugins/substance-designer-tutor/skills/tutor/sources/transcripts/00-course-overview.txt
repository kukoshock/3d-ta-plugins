so you want to learn substance designer
because you've seen the amazing
materials and all the tools that you can
create with it but you don't know where
to start and maybe you bit DED by the
nodes and the whole interface if that's
the case you're in the right place
because this course is for absolute
beginners my name is Louise I'm a
technical artist and together we're
going to create this beautiful fabric
material in sepson designer we'll start
from the very Basics and slowly make a
way up to more Advanced Techniques there
will be a lot of pauses and repetitions
so that you can experiment and practice
by yourself and what matters here is not
the material itself but the skills that
you will develop as You Follow The
Creation process so even if you're not
into fancy Fabrics this tutorial should
get you up and running for your own
personal project so this is the type of
fabric that we'll try to recreate has a
nice shine to it and as you can see the
ornaments are created in the weave
itself which makes it subtle but very
interesting from a technical point of
view now we won't be creating an exact
copy of this but this is the overall
look and feel that will try to achieve
we'll start by creating a simple thread
and see how we can weave it into a
complex structure you will then learn
how to make your own ornament base both
procedurally and by importing images
once this base is finished we will give
it a little twist by sewing a trim on
the edge which will let us cover some
hard surface techniques that you can
reapply to your own projects and once
we're done with the material creation
itself I will show you how to expose and
organize parameters so that you can
interact with the material outside of
substance designer now just a few words
about the course itself this series is
for beginners but even if you already
know a little bit the software you might
still find a few tips and tricks in it
so feel free to jump ahead to later
videos if you are a beginner though I
would strongly encourage you to follow
each episode chronologically and if
possible to have substance designer open
on the side so that you can follow and
experiment with each step I'll be using
substance designer 13.1 for this project
so if you have an older version some
nodes might missing it's not a big issue
and you can still follow along 90% of
the time and of course you can download
the project file so that you can study
things at your own pace I will also try
to keep an eye on the comments so if you
hit a ro block or have a question just
post it in the comments and I will do my
best to answer and let me finish by
saying that substance designer is my
favorite software ever and it is not as
complex as it looks so I really hope
that we'll grow to love it as much as I
do and with that said let's jump into
it for
