in this video we're going to see how we
can export a substance designning
material and use it in other apps we
already brushed over this in the
previous videos we mentioned SBS files
and SBS files but we also have the
outputs here so how does that all work
exactly there are two ways you can
approach it the first one is to Simply
export the outputs and load them as
regular Textures in whatever app you're
working in this method is quick and easy
but it's also a bit limited as you will
not be able to iterate on the textures
directly the second way is to publish
your material as a substance archive and
then to load it using the substance
integration that you will find in most
dcc's and game engines this method is a
bit heavier and requires more work but
it allows you to interact with the
material directly we're going to cover
both techniques in this video and we
will also see how we can send our work
to other substance apps such as
substance painter and Stager so let's
get started and we can begin with the
most straightforward option which is to
export the outputs directly now remember
that one of the first things we did when
we set up our project was to create
these outputs that are sitting at the
very end of our graph and each output
corresponds to a map so we have the
translucency map here the Amun occlusion
map the height map and so on if we want
to save these we can do it from the 2D
view directly by simply clicking on the
save icon but this is obviously not the
smartest way to handle this as you will
have to repeat this step for each output
so if you want to export your outputs
all at once you need to come over to the
toolbar and click on that wrench here
then go to export outputs it will prompt
you with this export window and there's
a few interesting things going on here
so let's break it down together first
there's of course the location where you
want to save your outputs to I'm going
to create a folder for that onet
fabric all right then you have the
format depending on the quality you're
looking for you can change that uh I'm
going to stick with PNG then below that
you have your outputs listed and so you
can decide to uncheck some of these in
case you don't want to export them all
you can change the color space as well
but the default is usually fine so I
wouldn't touch that and when you're
happy with your settings you can simply
click on export outputs now notice that
right above it we have this automatic
export option this is extremely useful
because it will allow you to create a
live link between your graph and
whatever third party software you're
going to render in so I'm going to check
that box too and click on export and now
if I navigate to the folder I created I
have all my maps properly exported and
ready to be
used all right let's now go over a
couple of scenes that I have opened here
first I have this blender project very
simple just a cloth mesh and a basic
lockout around it now to import my
designer outputs here it's very simple
I'm going to click on the mesh create a
material click on the main bsdf here and
to make things quicker I have the node
Wrangler activated and so if I press
control shift and T with my bsdf
selected it will open up my file
explorer I can then navigate to my
outputs folder and here I'm going to
select everything except two maps uh the
ENT occlusion I'm not going to use that
one because blender doesn't really read
it by default so we can skip this and
the translucency map this one we could
use but it needs its own Shader so you
would have to import it separately and
use a mix Shader note for that all right
so with all my maps selected I can just
click on principal texture setup and
then node Wrangler will automatically
connect each map to the matching input
here and that's it you don't need to do
anything else really now the cool thing
about this setup is that say I go back
to my graph and change my mind about
something for example I want to go for a
different preset then if I go back to
blender and refresh
textures it all updates accordingly so
this is how you create a live link
between your designer graph and your
material in another app of course the
same logic applies everywhere so here
for instance I have an unreal project
open I have all my maps here in the
content browser and here again I can
just iterate on my graph then reimport
the maps in unreal like so and there you
go everything updates very simple now
what if I don't want a simple live link
but the actual substance archive with
all its parameters directly in the app
I'm using well for that I would need two
things first I need to publish my
material as an sbsr which we haven't
done yet
and second I need to use the substance
integration to load it in my final
software so let's first go over the SBS
publishing process the hardest is behind
us now with all the exposing process
done so all we need to do now is to
publish it as an archive now a few
caveats here so remember we have two
graphs in our package and we're now in
our main graph right and if I take a
look at its attribute which is a tab we
haven't really covered we have quite a
few important things like like the name
of the graph then we have the type which
is set to UNS specified by default it's
not a huge deal you could leave it this
way but it's best to sort it in the
right group especially if you're going
to use it in another substance app like
painter so let's go for standard
material then you have the physical size
sliders now this is interesting we
haven't really touched upon this but if
you want your material to stay at scale
with your model this is the way you do
it you would obviously need to keep this
information in mind from the start like
saying okay so 800 threads in the warp
equals I don't know 100 cm and so on and
so forth the z-axis in this case
corresponds to the depth of the
displacement so we're not going to
bother with that but this is the kind of
metadata that can be useful in certain
workflows okay so let's scroll down a
little to this bit here this exposed in
sbsr button it said to yes which is
perfect but if we click on our subgraph
now you see that it's also set to yes
and we don't really want that because
this graph is just an internal utility
and not something that we want to
interact with so let's set it to no all
right we're good to go now ready to
publish this whole thing as a substance
archive to do so just click on the
package so if the option is grayed out
it's because you clicked on the graph so
on the package then on that little arrow
icon here and publish as sbsr or contrl
P we're going to leave everything at
default and simply choose a location
all right done now if you change
something in your project and you want
it to be updated in your sbsr you would
have to do it manually because it
doesn't auto update like the outputs
export so just click on that circling
Arrow here or control shift p all right
so I have my sbsr file here now what can
I just drag and drop it in blender or
unreal the answer is yes but to be able
to use an sbsr outside of substance you
will need to rely on the integration
that substance has so this integration
is usually like small plugins that you
can install for free in blender for
instance it comes as an add-on that you
can just download and install I'm not
going to show you the process for that
here but we have a dedicated video that
you can check out so with the add-on
activated you see that I now have this
substance tab on the side in my Shader
editor and I can load my sbsr directly
here all right and you see that below
that I now have all my parameters at
hand so let me just click on
apply and then I can interact with the
parameters directly here in blender so
this is really powerful just a quick
warning in case you tried it and it
doesn't work make sure you use the
latest version of these plugins as our
material uses notes that rely on
designer's latest engine so if you have
an error message or your material simply
doesn't load it's very likely that your
integration is not up to date as I'm
recording this I'm in blender 4.0 and
the substance add-on is 2.0 same goes
with unreal where we have this plugin
that you can find in the marketplace so
substance 3D for Unreal Engine once it's
installed and activate you will be able
to drag and drop any sbsr in your
content browser and play with the
parameters directly in
unreal other softwares like CL or
Marvelous Designer have the integration
already installed for you so you can
just load your material there and start
customizing it on the
spot so this is how you export and reuse
your SBS R there is one more scenario
that I like to cover and that's using
your sbsr within the substance ecosystem
so typically sending it to painter or
Stager if we come over to the publish
button you'll notice that we have these
send to options here and if I were to
click on any of these it would just open
up the app for me with my material
already imported and ready to be used
it's really convenient I use it all the
time so for instance I have this painter
project and if I do a s to
painter there we go my material
automatically pops up in the shelf and I
can start using it right away and of
course all my parameters are available
here as well so if I want to for example
get rid of the trim I can do it in one
click another thing that can be very
interesting is that with this kind of
setup you can take advantage of your
layers to customize your material for
instance let me show you I'm going to
add a pattern real quick below my fabric
layer to do this in a
mask grab something nice in the
textures all right and now if I add an
anchor Point here it will let me reuse
that information as a custom input
anywhere above this layer so if I switch
the ornaments type here to custom I can
then scroll down and load this Anchor
Point and use it to drive my ornament
weave I can even paint in there if I
want to
too like so look at that how cool is
that that's a really powerful
combination between proceduralism and a
more manual approach so you now know how
to export your work both in the
substance ecosystem and out of it and
this concludes our journey through
substance designer I hope you feel both
inspired and empowered to experiment
with your own ideas now substance
designer is a fascinating software that
offers endless possibilities and most
importantly it is very forgiving you
don't have to know everything about it
to get started so give it a try play
experiment and stay creative also don't
forget to share your first works with
the community we would love to see what
you create
