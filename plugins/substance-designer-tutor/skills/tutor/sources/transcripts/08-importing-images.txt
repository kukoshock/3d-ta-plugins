in this video we will see how we can
import images in substance designer and
how this can lead to very interesting
workflows now in the previous episode we
saw how we can create such images
procedurally and also the benefits that
come with it such as being able to
iterate easily on the shapes but
sometimes you already have an image that
matches exactly what you want so how can
you bring it into designer well that's
actually very simple so I have this
image here and I think it would work
well for a fabric all I have to do is
drag and drop it into my graph now the
second I do that Designer prompts me
with these two options you can either
link it or import it let's go for import
first when you import a file designer
will create a duplicate of that file and
store it in the substance package and
this duplicate is no longer linked to
the original meaning you can change it
or remove it from your disk it will not
affect the resource in designer this is
the option I would recommend when you
don't need to update the original file
and you just want to work in designer
from there now let's say I want to
import another image for instance this
one that I've been drawing in Photoshop
I'm not yet sure about these petals here
and I might want to change them
eventually so knowing that I would
rather link the image and by doing so I
actually created a live link between my
Photoshop export and my designer graph
so now I can go go back to photoshop
make a few
changes save and my node automatically
updates which is amazing because you can
really see it happen in real time see I
just love it the other cool thing about
linking your resources this way is that
you can build a dynamic node Arrangement
around them so in this case I could
let's say add a blur to my flower to
just soften the edges maybe level it a
little ADD the
warp a miror too why
not and now my Photoshop project is at
the root of a procedural setup and I can
manually control the main input like so
while relying on non-destructive
operations afterwards it's really The
Best of Both Worlds and not enough
people use it so I strongly encourage
you to explore this workflow so far it
all seems pretty easy and
straightforward but there are few two
caveats that we need to mention the
first has to do with ratios you may have
noticed that all the images I showed are
square and this is very important
designer is not really built to handle
non-square ratio so make sure that
whatever you choose to import is square
you can technically import non-s Square
images but it just make things more
complicated and we won't dive into that
for this tutorial in my case I just make
sure that I have the right ratio
beforehand for example in Photoshop I
usually use a template that is 2048x
2048 which is usually my working
resolution in designer the second
Pitfall I wanted to mention concerns the
distinction between color and gray scale
now you now know that most of your work
in designer is going to happen in Gray
scale and we already saw that we can't
mix gray scale and color but most of the
images you will import even when they
appear black and white will actually
come out as color and as soon as you
will try to use them you will get this
error connection and it can be confusing
because your image looks like it's
grayscale but if you pay close attention
to it you will see that it has this
yellow dot telling us that Designer
reads it as color and fixing this is
super simple you just click on your
imported image and in the properties you
will find these two buttons letting you
switch from color to gray scale so just
click on Gray scale and you're good to
go all right so you now know how to
import images in substance designer and
now it's up to you to decide whether you
want to use a specific image for the
ornament mask we're currently building
or if you want to stick with the
procedural shapes we created in the
previous video in my case I think I'd
like to make something out of this styze
flower we have here so let's do it
together I first need to make sure it
looks good when it's repeated in a
pattern and I'm going to use a simple
tile generator for that switching to
image input making it larger
then offsetting
everything okay I think I like it
there's just two things I'd like to
change um first i' like to flip the
pattern every other flower so that they
don't all face the same direction and in
order to do that I can simply take a
transform 2D and use it to flip the
image by clicking here on this small
horizontal mirror all right now I need
to find a way to fit it to the ti
generator and the problem is I don't
have any inputs left see the pattern
input is already taken but if I go in
the property panel of the tie generator
I can actually increase the number of
patterns here where it says pattern
input number so let's just push that to
two and plug our flipped version now we
have a mix between these two versions
and if I zoom out we can definitely see
that the repetition looks more varied
now but it's a bit too random for me so
in the pattern section I will switch the
pattern distribution from random to by
pattern number now to refine the overall
look we can take a moment to adjust the
blades a little uh feel free to
experiment on your own I would just
tighten up these spines towards the
bottom like
so and now that I look at it I think we
can also distort the flower way
more something like that
okay we now have a nice floral pattern
that is fully procedural and that can be
used as a mask in our main graph so how
can we connect the two right now you see
that we still have this warning telling
us that we have no outputs and that's a
problem because it means that nothing
can come out of this graph it's like a
closed box since we only want to Output
our mask here all we have to do is type
in
output and plug our final image to it
okay so now when you click on the output
you see that it comes with a bunch of
spaces for you to fill out the ones that
matter the most are the identifier and
the label the label is what the user
will see and interact with and the
identifier is what the software will use
to classify the node in this case uh it
doesn't really matter I'm just going to
rename both floral
ornament and that's it this is how you
create custom outputs from a subgraph
you could have several outputs if you
wanted for for example in this case I
actually made a second pattern out of
the random shape we created last time I
just twiced it a bit then I tiled it and
I think it looks okay and maybe I will
want to reuse it later in our main graph
so let's just create another output for
it and let's call this one geometrical
pattern all right so to sum up or
ornament subgraph here now has two
outputs that can be called upon in our
main graph here and the way you do that
is very simple let's double click the
main graph to enter it all right and now
we can just click the ornament graph
drag it in here then let go and now we
have this new node with the two outputs
we just created easy right so in this
video you learned how to bring in new
Resources by either importing them or
linking them remember use only Square
images and switch them to Grays scale
when needed
and in the next video we will use this
ornament mask we made to add an
additional weave to our fabric
