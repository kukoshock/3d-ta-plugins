what makes a material convincing and
pleasing to look at often lies in the
small details the little somethings that
just breathe life and personality into
it in this video I'd like to walk you
through a couple of techniques to make
your work look more realistic and
organic so here's our current height map
it's looking decent but we can push it
further with a few tricks first I feel
like things look a bit flat in the trim
area it looks like if it was just pasted
on top of the fabric instead of being
sewn into it and that's a flow I often
see in materials where you feel like the
various elements are just put on top of
each other without really interacting
with one another which often results in
that fake CG Loop so typically in the
case of our trim I would expect some
tension and bulging around here how can
we do that by now you should feel
familiar with the grayscale logic of
height Maps so what I have in mind is to
make the borders here lighter that is
higher than what is directly under the
trim so that we get some sort of raised
lip around it let's first see if we can
reuse something um we have the trim mask
here that could be a good starting point
because it traces perfectly the bits
that need to be lower but we can't use
it as is because if we were to subtract
it from the main
height like so you see that it would
just remove the trim Al together so
here's what we're going to do if we blur
this mask enough the shape will sort of
bleed out see how it
expands okay so let's keep it at
0.8 now again we can't use it like that
because it would remove the trim and we
don't want that so in order to protect
it we could take the non-blood version
and subtract it from
this like so let's put that in a blend
subtract and so you see the black areas
here are protected they're going to stay
at the same level these outlines though
are going to pull the fabric down giving
hopefully more depth and volume to our
trim so let's try it oh my look at that
it's exactly what we wanted see if I
mute the node with shift
d so you see it's not a lot of efforts
but it really makes a difference and add
realism to a
material now let's talk about
imperfections no material in real life
is perfectly straight or smooth or
uniform there will always be subtle
variations see about specks of dust tiny
fibers sticking out from clothing dents
and scratches on a heart surface and so
on all these irregularities do not make
a material flawed but it makes it real
and so if we aim at realism in our work
we need to pay attention to this now if
we look back at what we did in the
previous episodes we already try to take
that into account for example when we
sprinkled a bit of Randomness here and
there in the tie generators that was a
good start but let's push things a bit
further I would like to do two things
the first one is to apply micro
distortions to The Weave now when it
comes to distorting you already know
what kind of node we need yes we need a
warp but instead of using the basic warp
we're going to use the directional warp
the one with that Arrow
here it works the same way it takes an
input and a gradient map but it also
comes with an angle parameter and you
can distort in a specific Direction
which is very useful because then we'll
be able to align the Distortion with a
weave and so avoid having something too
jaring okay now let's plug it and that's
actually a good question where should we
put that war if we put it for example
here then it will also distort the trim
which we don't want so we need to make
sure we add it before all that so right
after the height plan here okay now for
the intensity input I like to have
something very directional but also with
a lot of control the directional
scratches would be perfect I think so
let's rotate it and plug it to a
directional warp to explain quickly how
it works so like I said the directional
warp pushes the input in a set Direction
so by default it will push horizontally
like that but we can change that so
let's go for
90° all right now it feels really strong
and overwhelming as is that's because
our intensity input here is quite noisy
so let's adjust it I'm going to start by
decreasing the pattern amount to 02
something very low then increase the
scale to nine so that we have more
shapes but smaller then we can refine
the scaling with the X and Y slider so
I'm going to thicken them a little on
the X and shorten them on the
Y we can also add a bit of
Randomness okay let's try with a warat
one
and shift d to compare before and
after all right that's very subtle but
it really helps breaking that uniformity
without getting too
distracting then last but not least I'd
like to add a feature that is specific
to fabrics and soft materials in general
and that is bolds and wrinkles it's a
fascinating topic and we could spend
hours on it but let's make it quick and
easy for this video since it concerns
the base Fabric and obvious L not the
gemstones or the trim we might be
tempted to add it right after the warp
here but I'm not going to do that and
for several reasons one reason is that
our current height map is well balanced
it works well everything fits nicely and
if I were to add large variations here
it may disrupt some of the things that
we added later the other reason is that
it's often simpler and more efficient to
add these kinds of finishing touches as
a separate normal map let me show you
how we're going to take that space just
above our main normal map and start
building a small FS generator here let's
start with a noise creas is usually a
solid base for that with these soft
lines um it's a bit too straight for me
so I'm going to quickly warp it so warp
and take a PE in scale it up and push
the
warp okay then I'm going to soften all
this with a blur
all right and now let's turn this into a
normal map so just take a normal note
plug it in and here increase the
strength quite a lot like six or
seven so we now have two normal maps how
can we combine them well if you type in
combine here's your answer so let's take
this normal
combine going to take this one
first and this second one here and you
see what it does it's a bit hard to tell
because it's super noisy but it
essentially keeps our original normal
information and just adds the folds to
it so let's plug it to our base material
to see how it looks in
3D not bad we can adjust the effect by
playing with the normal intensity of a
fult and balance it with the
blur okay I'm pretty happy with it
there's one problem though since we
added off folds at the very end of a
node Arrangement it means they also
affect the trim and the
gemstones fixing this problem shouldn't
be too hard what we could do is blur
this edge here so that we don't get any
intense folds in this area so far we've
only been using the high quality blur
and this node blurs uniformly the whole
input but when we need something more
selective we can use the nonuniform blur
as you would expect it's using an
intensity map a bit like the warp to
determine what part of the image to blur
and now we need to search for an
intensity input that could do the trick
again no need to create anything from
scratch we can probably get away with
one of the masks we already
made so let's see there was that trim
mask here and with a few adjustments it
probably can work now remember we dock
this to a DOT node meaning we don't have
to drive the connection across instead
we're going to call for a DOT node here
then select the trim mask from
there now to make it work obviously we
need to expand it we could do it with a
blur but I think a bevel would be more
efficient let's push it up to
0.1 and you see that since we're
expanding something that sits on the
very edge of the tile well it repeats on
the other side we don't really want that
so you know the real by now tiling
absolute and keep vertical tiling only
now okay let's plug that to the
intensity input of our non-uniform
blur and this is what we get we need to
make a few adjustments um I'm going to
push the samples to the max to have a
very smooth
transition then push the intensity to 25
or
something now let's reroot
everything and voila now no matter the
intensity of the fold you see they will
not affect this edge here so our problem
is fixed
let's frame
that call it fold there we
go all right so in this video we saw the
importance of details and Imperfections
when it comes to achieving realism in
your work we went over a couple of
techniques such as adding depth and
volume where two elements meet creating
micro distortions and finally creasing
the fabric a little with all these
details taken care of we can at last
move on to the other maps that make up
on material and I'll see you in the next
video to tackle the base color
