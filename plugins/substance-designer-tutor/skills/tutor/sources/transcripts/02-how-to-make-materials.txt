since everything in designer is based on
nodes let's answer that simple question
first what is a node nodes are the
building blocks of a graph you can think
of them as operators that transform in a
specific way any information you give
them so if we zoom on a node we can see
this little dots on each side on the
left is the input that is the image you
feed the node and on the right is the
output that is the result of the nodes
operation so for example here we're
plugging a dis in a swirl node the dis
is the input and the Twisted result that
I'm previewing here is the output I can
then take that output and run it through
another node and so on and so forth okay
so how exactly do you build a material
with nodes what's the typical workflow
and where do you even start to find out
let's examine this graph that we have
right here and break it down into its
different components now a graph reads
from left to right which means that this
is the very beginning of the work
whereas this is the final result and we
can already grasp how it's organized
thanks to the frames and you see that
the main ones are dedicated to specific
channels of the material we have
everything related to the base color
here the roughness is here and that big
gray box is for the height map notice
how it sits at the very beginning of the
graph the main takeaway here is that
when you build a material inp sance
designer you almost all always start
with the height so if I grab this big
block it highlights everything that is
connected to it and as you can see the
height information really flows into all
the different sections of the graph it's
not only converted into normal and
ambient occlusion Maps but it's also
used to create custom masks and drive
the roughness the color basically any
other map that's needed now as you may
know height maps are grayscale images it
means that most of the work that we'll
be doing in designer will be in gray
scale you can already see it simply by
looking at the colors of the
connections gray connections mean
grayscale nodes yellow connections mean
color nodes we will go over this later
in this course don't worry so let's
focus on the height we have here we can
easily display the result of any node
simply by double clicking it and as you
can see the graph really starts with
this basic brick structure and as we
move Downstream this simple structure is
slowly broken down into something more
complex and organic see we're adding
gradients warping the
edges blending in large noises Etc and
if we move further to the right we start
to see all the minute details appearing
such as this thin layer of dirt these
small bends and so on this demonstrates
The Importance of Being methodical and
organized when you tackle your height
typically here we started with the large
shapes or macro structure and gradually
move towards medium than small details
this workflow is well known and is
usually a safe guide to follow when you
build your material you can still go for
other methods for example when your
material is composed of one element that
is repeated multiple times then working
on the base unit first makes more sense
this is typically the case when you
create Fabrics you start by working on
the yarn shaping it in the right
position then tiling it into one large
woven piece once your height is finished
you can derive from it all the
information you need for the rest of
your Maps so for example if we want the
end of our tile here to be more Mossy
than the rest what we have to do is to
grab one of the masks from our height
section and use it in our color section
same goes for the roughness and
everything else so let's recap what we
just saw to create a material in
designer you typically start with the
height map building up grayscale
information in a methodical manner this
information can then be used to drive
and refine the other maps that make up
the material if you want to test your
understanding of this workflow a good
exercise would be to Simply look at some
materials and ask yourself how are they
built what's the main structure what
comes first and what comes last give it
a try and I'll see you in the next video
