in this video I'd like to make a quick
degression into inheritance in substance
designer what is it how does it work and
why do you need to understand it to make
the most of your graph now you remember
that each node comes with base
parameters and these parameters are
present in all the nodes see if I click
on any of these nodes they remain the
same we have things like the size the
bit depth the tiling Etc they can be
changed locally but before doing so it's
important to understand the logic behind
it next to each of these parameters
there is a little icon that indicates
the method of inheritance basically says
from which source the parameter gets its
value if we click on the icon you see
that there are three methods of
inheritance relative to input relative
to parent and absolute now please bear
with me here it's not that hard and it's
important that you feel comfortable with
these Notions so relative to input means
that the node takes its parameters from
its primary input what is piped into it
if you will you can spot the primary
input by these dark dots in the middle
so this one takes after this one which
takes after this one and so on and this
is how it goes for most nodes now please
note that it's important to keep track
of the primary input especially when it
comes to blending the primary input in a
blend is always the background I have
two notes here that I wish to blend a
gradient that has a 512 resolution and a
peine that has a 2048 resolution if I BL
blend the two by putting the gradient on
the top here my blend will inherit its
parameters from the pein and these
parameters will then be passed over to
the next node and so on and so forth but
if I swap the input and by the way
there's a need shortcut for that you
just press X so X to invert the
connections well if I do that my
gradient is now the primary input and so
the blend takes on that new 512
resolution which can cause issues down
the way this is especially true when it
comes to bit depth variations for
example if you blend an 8 Bits image
with a 16 bits image now we won't dive
into the bit depth topic but let me show
you a quick example I have this very
basic setup here and you see that I'm
blending an imported bitm that happens
to be 8 Bits if I plug it into the
primary input of my blend this bit depth
now propagates to the whole setup and it
results in these normal artifacts that
you see here because eight8 bits often
struggle with smooth
transitions so if you ever end up with
bending or stepping issues it's very
likely that you have an 8 Bits note
somewhere in your graph that messes with
the final result there are two ways you
can fix it the first solution would be
to Simply demote that image to the
foreground input so that the blend picks
its bit depth from here but if your
blend is not commutative meaning if your
inputs have to follow a certain order
then you will have to change the bit
depth of the culprit manually and I will
show you how in a second okay then we
have relative to parent the parent here
is the graph itself so if a node has its
base parameters relative to parent it
means that it's taking them after the
graph parameters which we had set
remember when we created the project now
I just said that most nodes were set to
relative to input but when there's no
input for example here we have a uniform
color where information only goes out
and nothing comes in well in this case
the node gets it space parameters from
the graph and finally we have absolute
this one is very straightforward it lets
you override any inheritance and change
the parameter yourself for a specific
node people are often confused as to why
these parameters are grayed out but it
actually Mak sense they are deactivated
as long as they get their value from an
external Source if you want to take over
this you just need to switch to Absolute
so block The Inheritance and set the
parameter yourself and this is what
we're going to do for this node here to
fix our bending issue just toggle the
bit depth to Absolute then manually set
it to 16 bits and now our artifacts are
gone let me illustrate quickly what we
just saw by getting back to our graph
and going to the very first node which
is this fibers one here and just by
looking at it I know that it must
inherit its space parameters from the
graph because it has no input so it
cannot be relative to input and if I
check the icon here it's indeed set to
relative to parent I'm going to switch
this to Absolute to set a lower
resolution and see what happens
Downstream and just as expected the
other nodes now take on that new
resolution because they inherited from
this guy here but for some reason our
tile generator has kept its original
2048 resolution can you guess why yes
well spotted the primary input here is
empty and so the node just falls back to
the graph resolution which in this case
is still 2048 by 2048 I hope it all
makes more sense to you now if you'd
like to know more about inheritance or
have other practical examples or use
cases I invite you to check out the
documentation page on that topic it's
really clear and helpful so go check the
link in the description and with that
said let's get back to our main graph
