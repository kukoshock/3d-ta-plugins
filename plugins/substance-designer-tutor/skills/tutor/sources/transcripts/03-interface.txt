before we get started on our project
let's take a moment to introduce
substance designer interface all these
panels can be a lot to take in so the
first thing I'd like to point out is
that you don't need to know them all to
start working in designer there are
menus and tabs that you will barely use
at first and as you grow more confident
and experienced you will have your own
preferred way of doing things so don't
feel like you have to know all the ins
and outs of the interface to get started
note also that these panels can all be
moved and shuffled to your own liking so
if you have multiple screens for example
it's really easy to create an
interesting layout you can at any point
revert to the default layout by clicking
on Windows reset
layout all right let's start with the
top left corner you will find there your
file manager this is where everything
related to your project is stored for
each project that you create you get
that box that you can collapse like so
this box is what we call the package as
you save your project you save an SBS
file that contains all these elements so
you can access them later on when you
reopen it so for example in this project
we have three elements we have two
graphs and one imported bit map it's
worth mentioning here that not
everything has to be done from scratch
in designer and that you can always
bring in external resources to speed up
your work we'll come back to this later
in this course below the file manager is
the library where you will find all the
substance designer resources that are
available to you I strongly encourage
beginners to explore it as it helps
grasping what to tools are available and
what are the possibilities you can for
example preview all the noises at your
disposal explore the different filters
and learn what each of them does as you
hover over them really useful now let's
move on to the Beating Heart of the
interface the graph view the graph view
is that large checkered area in the
middle of your screen this is where you
will spend most of your time in designer
as you start adding and connecting noes
navigating the gra view is very simple
press your middle Mouse button to pan
use your Mouse whe to zoom in and out
and if you accidentally get lost
pressing F will take you back to your
noes right above the cph view sits a
toolbar where you can access the core
nodes as well as some tools and
utilities to inspect your graph on the
right hand side is a very important
panel in which we will spend a lot of
time this is the properties panel it's a
context sensitive panel that changes
based on what is selected there are lots
of information displayed here and it may
feel overwhelming at first but we can
break it down easily the base part
parameters at the top are parameters
common to all the nodes and you won't
have to worry about them in the
beginning below them are the specific
parameters which show the settings of
the particular node that you have
selected and this is where you can
control Its Behavior finally we have two
important Windows below the graph the 3D
View and the 2D view they're important
because they're giving you the visual
feedback that you will need to examine
and balance your work the 3D view
displays your outputs in real time
giving you an interactive overview of
your material press your left Mouse
button to rotate the model middle Mouse
button to pan and right Mouse button to
zoom in and out or simply use the scroll
wheel to rotate the environment light
hold contrl shift and right click while
dragging your mouse sideways like so you
will find yourself doing this quite
often because it lets you see how your
material behaves under different
lighting angles by default designer will
display your material on a rounded Cube
but you can change that in the scene
menu right here there are more menus and
parameters to explore in the 3D view but
let's skip that for later next to it is
the 2D view it displays you guess it 2D
images most specifically it shows the
current state of any node you double
click on and it really complements the
3D view by letting you inspect up close
the result of any operation this is
great for monitoring the gray scale
values searching for artifacts and
errors but also making sure your
material tiles properly so to sum up
when you create a project in designer it
gets stored in a package that contains
your graphs and resource and sits in the
project manager on the left most of your
work will then take place between those
four Windows you add and connect nodes
in your graph view you adjust their
settings in the properties panel and you
check the result in real time in your 3D
and 2D view now let's set up our project
