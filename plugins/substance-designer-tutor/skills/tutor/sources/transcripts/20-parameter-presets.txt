in this video we're going to see how we
can expose the rest of the parameters in
our graph and I think that after the
ornament mask this highight blend where
we combine the base weave with the
ornaments could be a good candidate I'm
thinking in particular this offset
slider that controls the emboss level so
let's click here and expose as new graph
input I'm going to call this one
ornament emboss intensity all right now
this this time we're going to stick with
the slider editor and let's take a
moment to go over these different
sliders that we have here so default is
the value that we had before exposing
the parameter and it means that it's
always going to start from this value
which is perfect because it means you
don't lose your settings when you expose
something then we have the Max and mean
sliders they indicate the maximum and
minimum values that the user will be
able to pick and you see that we have
this clamp option set to true meaning he
will not be able to override these
values by typing in something else you
could give more Freedom by disabling
that but in the case of this offset
slider I would rather not give too much
freedom because we want the effect to
remain quite subtle so not only will I
keep the range clamped but I will even
narrow it by saying that the value
should stay somewhere between 0.5 and
0.6 all right then we have the steps
options that just indicate the slider
increments we're not going to change
that okay now let's test this by double
clicking in the graph going to the
preview Tab and just playing with the
slider all right you see I think the
range is just right not too much not too
little okay what's next let's take a
step back and ask ourselves what other
users might want to play with now
obviously we have the trim and ornaments
that take up a big part of our graph but
these elements won't be so easy to
expose because they are arranged in a
way that makes it hard to change again
this is something to keep in mind while
you build your node Arrangement if you
want a certain feature to be dynamic and
highly customizable you need to build it
in a way that makes it easy to change so
I'm not going to expose anything in the
trim or the gemstones right now because
they work well as they are but I'd like
to come back to a little problem that we
had remember with these three transform
nodes that are duplicates but not
synchronized
and I told you then that the issue with
this setup is that if we wanted to move
the gemstones here the mask just
wouldn't follow and so it would break
everything well it happens that exposing
can help with that because it allows to
link nodes to one another let me show
you let's take this main transform here
and decide that this is going to be the
one that leads the other what we're
going to do is find what controls the
position so the offset sliders here and
simply expose
them call it gemstone
position okay now here's the trick if
you want these other transforms to have
the same value as this one all you need
to do is come over to the offset here
and instead of exposing the parameter we
can decide to reuse an existing value
and the offset that we previously
exposed is listed here so you just click
on it
it okay let's do the same for that
second
one and now look if we twick this main
transform that we exposed here well the
other transforms just follow and
everything stays in place this is
incredibly useful as you will often need
a node to share its settings with other
nodes so remember just expose the main
node then reuse its value wherever you
need and we're actually going to put
that into practice right now there is
one thing that I would like the user to
be able to do in one click and that is
disabling the trim and gemstones all
together to have just a plain fabric
this sounds like a tricky thing to do
because everything now is interconnected
see if I select all the dots that we are
using oh boy so how are we going to
approach this the solution I have in
mind is to use switch node so for
instance let's focus on the height I can
use a switch to toggle two two versions
of the height one version with just the
plain Fabric and one version with all
the ornaments I'm going to put the final
height in the first
slot and take the plain wave so just
before the trim using Dots here to keep
the connection clean and
readable all right and now I can toggle
the ornaments on and off in just one
click easy right so let's reconnect this
now you can probably guess what the
problem will be yes we can change the
height but our other maps are using
masks that do not directly rely on it so
when we disable the ornaments in the
height they still remain in the color
the roughness the metallic and so on the
easiest way to fix this is simply to
repeat that switch operation in each
Channel and since we still want the user
to have only one button to click on to
disable everything we're going to start
by exposing using that first switch
which is going to be our master switch
if you will so I'm going to call it trim
and rename the default true false to yes
no which is a bit easier to understand
in my
opinion okay now we need to repeat that
operation for each Channel and don't
worry it's going to be quick and easy
let's start with the color this time
we're going to add a switch color
obviously and here we need to follow the
same structure so the final version will
go on top and the plain fabric so right
before the ornaments will go here okay
now all we have to do is to link it with
our main switch by selecting it
here and if we test it now by going to
the graph parameters you see that they
are now synced perfect and now we need
to do the same for the other channels so
I'm going to speed up the process here
you get the idea metallic
roughness what's important is to keep
the same order with the final version on
top and the plain version at the bottom
and for the displacement and
translucency I'm simply using a uniform
black as the plain
input like
so all right we're done with our switch
setup Let's test it
again there we go we can now deactivate
the whole Trim in one click how cool is
that all right there are a few more
parameters that I think we should expose
before we move on for instance we should
be able to interact with
theault so I could just expose the fold
intensity here so expose as new graph
input folds
intensity all
right then we have the colors which is
probably the first thing that people
want to change in a material now colors
can be tricky let me explain why I'm I'm
going to start with the ornament frame
here this setup is easy to expose
because all we have to do is click on
the colors then Expose and the user will
be able to pick the color he wants with
the ey dropper or using the sliders so
I'm going to call this one gemston
color all right can do the same for the
metal okay so that was easy but what if
I want to change the color of the fabric
itself this is where things get a bit
more
complicated at the root of our fabric
color we have this gradient map node
remember with this color ramp and all
the keys this node is great but the main
drawback is that you can't expose any of
it so whatever you set up here has to
stay in the graph and can't be accessed
from the front end there are different
ways around this um if you want to have
full control over the colors the best
would be to only blend uniform colors
like what we did here
if you still want to work with gradients
then you could use an hsl node so hsl to
control the Hue I'm not a big fan of
this solution as I find the slide is a
bit hard to control but it can
definitely be a good option depending on
what you're looking for now in this case
what I'm going to use is a color match
node I'm going to make it default to our
original Green just picking the same
green
like
that and now I can expose this color
just like we did with the
ornaments and that's it we can now
change the fabric color in one
click okay so we're done with the colors
do we have anything more to
expose um let me see yes I would like to
be able to edit the roughness now
remember when we created this base out
of the curvature map I told you that
using a histogram range would prove
useful all I have to do now indeed is to
expose that position slider that
controls how dark or light the fabric is
so let's expose
that fabric
roughness maybe limit the range here
let's say between 3 and
6 okay I think all the important
parameters are exposed so it's time to
check how things look in the preview tab
making sure everything works
pushing all the
buttons and you see that it gets busy
pretty quickly so it's important that we
tidy this up as much as possible the
first thing we should improve is the
order for instance I think the trim
switch should come first as it controls
the main feature of a
material to move it in the list we need
to go to the parameters Tab and here we
can drag and reshuffle anything so I'm
going to take this and put it at the
very beginning of the list
then I think it would make more sense to
place all the parameters related to the
trim after this button so gemston
position
color this one too and I also think I
would put the false parameter at the
bottom they're not as important it's
more of a finishing
path all right that's already better
there's one more thing that I'd like to
do before we move on to the presets when
I de table the trim you notice that the
trim parameters remain and that's not
ideal but you now know how to fix this
remember at the bottom of each parameter
we have the visible if section so we
just need to write the proper
instruction here if you forgot what the
logical expression should look like
don't worry you're not the only one uh
you have an example in the tool tip here
or you can just be lazy like me and copy
it from the list in the documentation
since in our case we want to tie it to a
switch which is a Boolean operator
I'm going to copy this one
here paste it in the visible if field
and just add the proper identifier which
in this case is
Twitch let's test
this there we go it just goes away when
I deactivate the
trim we can now copy this expression and
paste it in all the train
parameters so here
and
here let's
see
perfect we are now done with the
exposing process you see that our
parameters are much better this way with
a clear hierarchy and structure they are
easy to use and let us interact with
important feature of the material so we
can stop here let's finish by talking
about the presets you may have notice
that when we tweak parameters in preview
mode the drop down menu at the top
changes from default to unsaved settings
it means that we can configure things in
a specific way then save that
configuration to apply it later on so
let's customize our Fabric in the preset
tab I would like to have a plain version
so no
trim um geometrical
pattern and a bright golden
hue maybe lower the roughness a little
and with all these adjustments done I
can simply give it the name so I don't
know golden
plane and click on new and now these
settings are saved and when I'm in
preview mode I can switch between the
default preset and this new preset that
I just made it's just a neat way to
showcase the possibilities that come
with your material I'm going to make
another one
quickly give it a nice blue
hue make it a bit rougher
enable the
trim make it silver instead of
gold adjust the
gemstones all right let's call this one
called
Blue then we can test
this
awesome all right so material is now
ready to be exported and reused
elsewhere congratulations if you've made
it so far in this course in the next and
last video we will see how we can
publish this and bring it to other apps
