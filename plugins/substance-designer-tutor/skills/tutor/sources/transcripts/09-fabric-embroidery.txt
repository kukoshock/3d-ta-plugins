hello again the time has finally come to
add the ornaments to our plain fabric so
in this video we will see how we can
combine two weaves using masks like the
one we created in the previous episode
but before we do that I'd like to come
back to this part of the graph and
address a question that you may have so
in the beginning we started by creating
our thread and we added quite a few
details to it like this directional
noise here to give the look of fibers
but after that we tiled it heavily and
in the process it seems like like we
lost most of the work we put into it
like if we zoom in super close you
realize that our thread is now barely
taking up a dozen pixels and we can't
see any variations there are two things
to consider here the first is the fact
that this individual thread we carefully
built is now at our disposal and we can
reuse it for many different things
throughout this project so it's
important to have something that looks
good at every scale the second thing to
keep in mind is resolution
so far we've been working with the
default 2048x 2048 resolution which is
fine for most of what we want to do it's
pretty light so there is no lag the 2D
view is very responsive and we can still
see most of the details so that's a good
trade-off but at some point we may want
to uprise everything to 4K to get even
more details typically if you wanted to
render close-ups of your material for
example if that's the case it's a good
idea to change your graph resolution
from time to time just to check how
things things look with a higher
resolution and you do that by going at
the top of your graph here and by
clicking on whatever resolution you want
to test uh except 8K maybe I would say
keep away from this one as it will make
everything extremely heavy and slow so
let's click on
496 and you see that Designer instantly
recomputes all the nodes and now I can
see the new result in my 2D and 3D View
and the threads in my tile generator are
much more detailed now I can even make
out some of the fibers so it just goes
to show that adding details to a small
element can totally be worth it because
it might be reused for different
purposes or simply show better at higher
resolutions with that being said let's
switch the resolution back to 2K because
it just makees things a bit faster and
since all of this is fully
nondestructive we can always go back and
forth between different resolutions if
we want to all right now let's tackle
that additional weave we want to sort of
embroider on top of this space we have
our ornament mask here that we created
in a dedicated subgraph and we can
preview them by double clicking on the
outputs we have floral ornament and
geometrical ornament perfect Now to
create another weave we could reuse one
of the techniques we already covered
such as tiling the thread at this time
instead of using a tile generator for
that we're going to use a tile
sampler okay okay let's face it this
node is a bit dating but it's also one
of my very favorites so let's break it
down real quick now you see if we look
at its thumbnail and first input it
looks very much like a tile generator
basically takes an input and tiles it so
why is it so much bigger well if we look
at the description it says that the
style generator can sample in a texture
to parameterize each pattern properties
size position rotation Etc and you see
that indeed we have inputs for each of
these properties and that's why the node
is so big now what does that mean
exactly well it means that we can drive
any of these parameters using a texture
so let me give you a quick example I'm
going to take a good old peing
noise and connect it to I don't know uh
the size parameter for instance now if I
go in the tile sampler and enable the
scale map multiplier the squares get
resized dynamically based on that noise
so basically where the map is white the
squares are scaled up and where it is
black they are shrunk down hopefully you
grasp how powerful this is now let's
reset
this and start building a simple wave
with it we can reuse of course our base
thread for that switching to pattern
input and now let's make a few changes
for the amount I'm going to go with
something pretty high like 600 on the X
and and 700 on the
Y okay let's increase the scale to
3.8 rotate the whole thing 90° because I
want the threads to go
vertically and finish with a nice
offset all right so far nothing very
different from what we've been doing
with a child generator but this is where
things get interesting what I like is to
use the mask we prepared last time and
tell the tile sampler to keep the
threads only in the white areas and that
should be easy all we have to do is take
the mask I'm going to take the flowers
for this and plug it where it makes the
most sense now we have a mask input here
that could work perfectly but I'm
actually going to plug it in the scale
map input because it gives a softer
result that I like better now let me
enable the multiplier once more in the
size
section and there we go you see that
where the mask is white the threads keep
their original size whereas they become
so tiny that they disappear where it's
black now what is very interesting here
is the transition the mask is not acting
like a cookie cutter that just knocks
off chunks of fabric but it's actually
acting at the thread level so it's
removing bits by bits which is exactly
how it works in real life so that's
perfect all right to finish this up I'm
just going to add a bit of Randomness
here and
there uh just a bit in the luminance
here
too just so that it's not perfectly
uniform okay I also feel like the result
is a bit too contrasted so I'm going to
make quick level pass
here pushing the gamma to the
left and reducing the overall
Luminosity just to have something a bit
more
flat all right so we have a second weave
and it comes already masked so all that
is left to do now is to blend it with
our base we could use a simple blend for
that but the thing is we need to be very
precise and subtle here and it may
actually be a lot of work where we would
need to use levels blurs and so on but
there is a note that can handle all
these tedious adjustments for us and
that is the height
blend this node looks a bit like a
regular blend like we have the three
outputs with the foreground the
background and a mask input but it also
comes with very handy sliders that will
make our life easier and it outputs a
mask on top of everything which will be
very useful later on so let's take our
base weave and put it in the
background and add the ornament weave in
the
foreground and okay the result is very
subtle at first but that's exactly what
we want we don't want big grayscale
variations that would make our ornaments
pop out too much they need to be almost
at the same level as the rest of the
fabric so let's check how it looks in 3D
by re-rooting the Conn
connections all right it's very faint in
the 3D view as well but it's definitely
there see now we can make it a t more
obvious by playing with these two
sliders the offset slider controls how
far above the background your input will
be so in our case we can go slightly
above
0.5 but not too
much then if we drop the contrast a
little we get these blurred edges that
just help highlighting the shape
I let you play with this until you reach
something that you like here again
there's no right or wrong I would say
that the visual feedback from the 3D
view is super important so don't
hesitate to inspect your mesh under
different angles move the light around
zoom in zoom out Etc in a project such
as this one I would even suggest
changing the display mesh so you go to
scene then try the cloth mesh it's just
nice to preview fabric on actual cloth
geometry and you get a better idea of
how your material will look and feel in
its final form
perfect all right so in this video we
finally added ornaments to a plain weave
we saw how we can Leverage The Power of
the tile sampler to do Advanced tiling
and masking and how the height blend can
help us be more precise and efficient
when it comes to blending height
information in the next video we will
tackle the shiny trims that ored the
edges so be ready for more shape
