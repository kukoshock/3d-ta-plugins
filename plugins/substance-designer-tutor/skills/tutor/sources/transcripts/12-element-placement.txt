all right you now know everything about
base parameters and inheritance so let's
get back to our trim and let me just
reassure you most of the times you won't
have to touch the base parameters or
think about inheritance at all but in
some cases you need to understand at
least the basics and the use case at
hand here was to fix our tiling problem
and tiling is a base parameter so we had
to go through this right now it's grade
out because it's set to relative to
input so let's switch that to Absolute
and now we can choose what type of
tiling we want get disable the
repetition completely or just on one
axis so let's go for vertical tiling and
there we go we have a nice single row of
threads all we have to do now is to
place it where we want here I'm just
using the offset slider because it's
more
convenient all
right somewhere around the edge here
okay we can now blend this with our
base let's go for Max mode
okay let's maybe scale down the threads
one more
time put them back into
place you see that here I'm struggling
to re-root the connection after the
height blend that's actually because of
the connection mode I'm in when you're
in material mode it can sometimes
prevent some outputs to be properly re
rooted um I could switch to standard
mode to fix this but I'm just going to
do it manually this
time okay I think it's tends out a bit
too much like the profile is too rounded
so I'm just going to fix this quickly
with the
levels Shifting the
gamma perfect we added the first row of
our
trim now we just have to repeat these
steps for the next rows and that
shouldn't be too hard for the sequence
we can use the exact same technique so
offset duplicate
recenter blend then adjust the size so
that they overlap
nicely then we take another transform to
tile them in a row switching the tiling
to Absolute then to Vertical only and
dividing all right you see with practice
you get pretty fast at it now let's
blend this with our
base then place it next to the threads
now it's a bit hard to see because it
sits on the very edge of the tile but we
can fix this in the material property of
the 3D view simply shift the u a little
with this tiling slider don't worry it's
not going to change the actual tiling of
the material it's just about the
preview all right it's already looking
pretty good if you ask me of course if
we look at it up close well we see some
artifacts due to the resolution but if
we switch to 4K you see that the result
is very decent
so we can go back to our 2K resolution
without worrying too much about it we
have one last row to add and you know
the drill by now so why don't you pause
the video and try it I'm just going to
do it quickly on my
side maybe rescaling a
little this time we don't need to do all
that duplicating and blending we can
just tile it directly removing the
horizontal
tiling then adding it to the main
connection
okay and here again I think I'm going to
adjust the levels a
little like
so and when I look at it I still feel
like we're losing too much details even
in 2K I'd like it to be more crisp so
I'm just going to add a sharpen
here all right see the difference it
makes if I mute the not with shift d it
really
helps all right so we made good progress
on our Trim in this video we learned how
to use the dot node to organize our
connections we practiced a little or
shape creation skills in the next video
we will add the gemstones to wrap up the
trim
