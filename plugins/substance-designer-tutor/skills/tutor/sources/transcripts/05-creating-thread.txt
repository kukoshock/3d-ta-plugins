in this video we will start building a
fabric material beginning with the base
unit that makes up any fabric the thread
now this is a small note Arrangement
that we're going to create it may not
look like much but it's going to take us
through some of the most important
actions that you will need to master in
designer so go grab yourself a cup of
coffee and let's jump into it so this is
where we left off we have a base
material Noe that we used to preview our
height in the 3D View and we are not
relying on displacement yet but only on
normal and occlusion data right now we
don't really see anything because well
we haven't created any height map yet
notice that we still have that annoying
warning telling us to create output so
let's just do it now if you go to your
base material node and right click it
you will see that we have a create menu
here click on output nodes and say no to
this and that's it designer
automatically created outputs for each
Channel now we don't have to worry about
it anymore and we'll go back to this
later when it will be time to export our
work so I'm going to give myself a bit
more space to work from because as you
now know a graph reads from left to
right so what we are going to create
today will be a starting point and what
we created in the previous video will
actually be our finish so all of our
work will have to fit between these two
but no worries we can Shuffle and
rearrange nodes as we go now at this
point you may experience the blank page
syndrome and yes that wide empty space
can be dating if you don't know where to
start this is what you need to remember
every complex structure is made out of
simple elements so the key here is to
really break down the difficulty in
smaller simpler steps in the case of a
fabric what you need to ask yourself is
what is the simplest element what is the
building block and the answer to this is
of course the
thread all right so let's hit that space
bar and search for first node to build
our thread now you may be tempted to
type in thread or something to see if
anything shows up but yeah you see that
we don't really have anything except
that threshold node there is actually a
good node for what we want to do and if
you search fiber there is this fibers
one node so let's bring it in to have a
closer look what this node does is that
it recreates the look of fibers woven in
a yarn with that slanted rep ition you
see here so you see in the parameters on
the right that this node doesn't have
many options apart from The Styling
slider we don't need to tile it yet so
let's keep it at one but it's still
worth noting that this note does tile
seamlessly by default and this is
something we can check by clicking in
the 2D view then pressing space bar this
hotkey is what will show you how a
texture repeats so you can investigate
the seams if needed with that red line
and as you do so sometimes times you
might zoom in or zoom out too far and
lose the Central Square if that happens
no worries just press F to focus back on
the main Square then press space bar
again to disable the til view now this
fibers one is going to be our starting
point so we may as well connect it to
the little setup we built last time
right just to see how things look in 3D
remember we left click on the output and
let go then simply navigate to where you
want to put it and as you bring it close
enough to an input it will just snap to
it like that then you click again to
dock it there now if we move the cube a
little we start to see something's
happening but it's still very faint
right so what I'd like to do is crank up
the normal a little just so we can see
better what we're doing so let's click
on the normal node to access its
properties on the right and boost the
intensity to something like I don't know
five or six up to you now we also need
to connect our first note to the ambion
occlusion how do we do that we could
navigate all the way back to the
beginning grab the connection again then
travel back to the emion occlusion node
uh but thankfully there's an easier way
of doing it when we want to reuse a
connection that is used somewhere near
we can just control click it and it will
create a duplicate of that connection
for us then plug it again again control
click to borrow a connection
we are now previewing on one thread in
the 3D view so we can rotate the cube to
inspect it and different angles uh we
can move the light around by pressing
control shift and dragging from left to
right so now we need to refine it
because obviously it doesn't look great
here's two thing I'd like to do the
first would be to narrow it a bit on the
vertical axis to make it smaller and
more dense and this is something you
will find yourself needing all the time
in designer just moving things around
but the thing is you can't select
elements and move them like you would do
on a canvas in illustrator or photoshop
for example instead we have a node
dedicated to just that and this is
transform
2D this note is very handy and you will
quickly get familiar with it so as soon
as I select it see we have a manipulator
that shows up in the 2D View and that
lets me rotate scale move the input now
just a few shortcuts to know here um
pressing shift will keep your scaling
uniform slap the rotation and keep the
translation to one
axis if you hold control and shift at
the same time it will scale from the
middle and if you want to get into fancy
effects pressing alt will let you skew
the
image now not everything has to be done
with these handles you can also use the
sliders in the properties panel if you
want to to be more precise and these two
buttons here let you scale up or down
with power of two so it's very quick but
it also retains the tiling and this is
actually quite important most of your
work in designer will aim at producing
diable materials right and the thing is
the transform 2D can break the tiling if
you're not careful so if I display the
repetition remember how by pressing
space bar and start moving and rotating
randomly you see what happens even if I
try to be careful seams are bound to
appear if you really want to make sure
you're not breaking anything you can use
the safe transform 2D node it is more
limited but it will also protect your
tiling in our case tiling shouldn't be a
problem because we're going to remove
the borders anyway so let me start a
fresh with a new transform 2D all I want
is to squash it down a little so I'm
going to grab this handle I'm going to
hold control and gently pull it
down and to make it more dense I might
also just divide the whole thing by
two all right now how can we connect
this new result with our main stream
that we have here now the good news is
that we don't have to take that output
and replug everything manually to each
node so instead I'm going to show you a
very simple trick to save you some time
if you press shift while left clicking
on the main output it will attach to
your cursor the whole bundle of
connections and you can can reroot them
all by sort of jumping over the output
of the new node that you want to include
so again let me do it one more time I
press shift while clicking on the output
and then I let go over the new output
our three view is now updated and we can
start deciding what to do next I think
the next thing I should do is find a way
to taper it on both ends to create that
sort of
Overlook the one way of doing it would
be to take well an oval shape and
multiply it on top so that everything
outside of the oval would be dark this
is something that is very easy to do in
substance designer to do it we need to
bring in two nodes that you will use all
the time we will bring the blend Noe and
we will bring the shape
Noe let's have a look at that blend Noe
first you see that it has three inputs
the first two one are half yellow half
gray which means that you can either
blend color nodes or grayscale nodes but
keep in mind you can't blend a color
node with a grayscale node if you do so
you will get that Red Connection
signaling an error there's also a
hierarchy between these two inputs while
the foreground input is the one that
will act upon the background so the
background comes first and the
foreground comes on top of it let's have
a quick look at the parameters to
demonstrate what they do I will make a
simple blend between two colors so we
first have an opacity slider that
controls how much the foreground acts
upon the background see as I decrease
the opacity the blue Fades back to red
and vice
versa as you may have guessed we can
also control it using the opacity input
here this one is basically a mask input
so it's expecting grayscale information
even if you are blending colors so if I
were to use well for example let's take
our fibers one here and plug it into the
opacity input what do you think will be
the result take a moment to think about
it you can even pause the video if you
want as you may have guessed it's giving
us this image where opacity input is
white that is around the middle here the
blue foreground takes over whereas the
black areas mask it out and let the red
background appear hopefully you get the
logic of it we'll be repeating this kind
of operations a lot during this course
so don't worry if it still feels a bit
abstract and last but not least the
blend node comes with blending modes
like multiply add subtract and so on if
you're not familiar with what blending
modes are and how they work you can
check out this video on the topic but
again we will keep things very simple in
the beginning so no need to worry too
much about it all right let's get back
to our thread like I said what we need
is to blend this base with some kind of
oval shape so we first plug this into to
the background input because we want it
to be affected by whatever we put on top
right and now let's take a look at that
shape note we added that second node at
first side it looks like an empty white
node but if we look at its properties we
see that it's actually a library of
Primitives we can scale them we can
rotate them tie them we can also scale
them non uniformly which is perfect to
create an oval all we have to do now is
choose a nice soft round shape like I
don't know a bell for
example then we can squash it slightly
on the Y and I would maybe elongate it
on the X a little but huh it seems that
we're stuck at one and we can't go any
further well actually we are not in
substance designer you can override most
of the limits by typing in the values
you want so in this case I'm going to
type something slightly above one like
1.2 or something all right now all we
have to do is take that shape that nice
oval shape we made and plug it above of
fibers in the blend node like
so then we will change the blending mode
to multiply and here we go you see that
we now have these nicely tapered ends
just like we wanted let us reroot our
connections once more to preview the
result holding shift and moving it back
into place
okay now we start to see our oval shape
appearing with that nice bulge in the
middle it's still too faint though so
one way we can fix this is by tweaking
the grayscale values of our thread now
if you're not familiar with what these
values mean let's do a quick recap so
the way a height Map works is basically
the lighter the value the higher the
area and the darker the value the lower
the area so where our map is white it
means the texture will be pushed up and
where it is black it means it will be
pulled down so to demonstrate this more
clearly I'm going to activate the
displacement on our rounded Cube here to
do so I need to activate two things
first I need to activate the height
input in the base material node right
set it to true and plug our last node
directly into it this one doesn't need
any companion node nothing changes yet
in the 3D view but if I come over to the
material properties and go to material
default edit I can access the parameters
that control how the material is
displayed in the 3D view I'm just going
to scroll down to the height section and
push the height scale to I don't know 10
maybe
20 all right now hopefully you see that
the whites here are being pulled up and
that the gray gradient that we have here
in the 2D view is translated to a height
slope here in in the 3D view now that we
have this good illustration let's see
how we can change the look of our
current displacement by playing with the
grayscale values themselves designer
comes with a lot of tools to do it
histogram highpass contrast but we're
going to start with the most important
one the levels note if you have any
experience with image editing softwares
this view should feel familiar levels
basically allow you to remap the values
of an input image bending or reducing
the high and low points as well as
Shifting the transition between the two
now in our case all we want is to
tighten up that shape a little so we
have a more rounded profile so I'm just
going to take that low pin at the top
here and push it slightly to the right
and I'm going to move the middle pin to
the left in order to shift that
transition between high and low like
so see how we changed our thread
profile perfect and we can easily
compare the difference it makes by
temporarily muting the levels if I
select it and press shift and D the node
becomes disabled see it's still there
but it's sort of invisible and I can
toggle it on and off with that same
shortcut to check the result which is
often very useful especially when you
have very subtle effects all right looks
good to me now don't worry if the levels
notes still seem a little abstract to
you it's one of these notes that just
becomes more and more intuitive as you
use it and we will use it a lot in this
project all right our base thread starts
to look okay but it still misses a
little something in my opinion if I take
a look at my reference you see that yarn
is usually very fibrous and if you look
at it up close you will see all these
tiny fibers tightly spent together now
we do have this slanted structure but
it's pretty basic so what we can do is
add an extra level of complexity simply
by blending in a noise on top of this
current state and we need two things for
that first we need some kind of noise
obviously so let's open up our quick
sarch by pressing space bar and see what
we have if we type in noise and we have
a lot of options and with practice you
will get to know most of these by heart
in my case I already know exactly what
kind of noise we need so I'm going to
scroll down until I reach the
directional noises these are great for
everything that has a very directional
or layer structure uh think about wood
brushed Metals fabrics and so on I'm
going to go with directional scratches
and place it right next to our last note
we now need to somehow mix these two
together how can we do it I suggest you
post the video if you've been following
along and try to find the solution by
yourself done you probably guess that we
need a blend node for that so let's just
take our base
thread put it in the background of the
blend and put the directional scratches
on top as for the blending mode let's
stick with multiply for this one now the
effect is way too strong by default so
we can turn it down by decreasing the
opacity by half but it still doesn't
look quite right the noise that we
picked is too detailed and small
compared to our thread and it's going in
the wrong direction too the good news is
that it's a procedural noise meaning
that it's not a still bit map but a
dynamic recipe that we can interact with
so let's just click on it to access its
properties and you can see that we have
quite a few parameters uh the first one
I'd like to change is the scale let's
take that down to
one it's better but still not enough so
what we can do next is reduce the
pattern amount to somewhere around 02 it
would just give us more space to enlarge
these long Stripes which we can do using
these X and Y sliders here I'm just
going to take a second to fiddle with
them
elongating on the Y thickening on the X
until that empty space is mostly filled
the last thing we need to do is adjust
the rotation and i' like to align it
with a thread structure the thing is
when I want to edit the noise properties
all I see is the noise itself but
designer actually allows you to edit a
noes properties while previewing another
node in the 2D view so just bear with me
on this see when I I double click on a
node I get these two little icons on the
top the sheet icon indicates that this
node properties are currently displayed
here on the right panel and the Checker
icons means that this node output is
also displayed in the 2D view now if I
were to single click another node you
will see that the properties icon
follows wherever I click but I'm still
previewing my directional scratches this
doesn't look like much but it's actually
super handy so let's put it into
practice right now what I want is to
change the noise rotation while
previewing the result of the blend in
real time all I need to do for that is
to double click the blend to display it
in the 2D view then single click the
noise to access its properties and now I
can easily align the scratch's rotation
while using the thread structure as a
guide all right we made it we made the
base thread that will support a whole
fabric material not bad this no
Arrangement may look very simple but it
took us through some of the most common
techniques in designer creating shapes
moving blending leveling and adding
noise in the next video we will see how
we can turn this individual thread into
a complex woven
structure e
