in this video we're going to take a look
at how to create the roughness and
metallic maps of a material in substance
designer these two maps usually come
last in the creation process we first
had to build up the height then apply
some colors and now it's finally time to
add the finishing touches if we look at
what we achieved so far let me just
switch the preview cloth
mesh so if we look at this we see that
even though all the elements are in
place and the colors are done it still
misses something like it looks a bit
flat right and this is where roughness
and metallic information can help the
roughness map determines if a surface is
smooth or irregular if it is smooth the
reflections are going to be focused and
bright and the more we shift towards a
rough surface the more the reflections
are going to be spread out and dim here
again we'll need to play with Grays
skill values the darker the value the
smoother the surface and the lighter the
value the rougher the surface there is
no real rules when it comes to roughness
Maps so you have a lot of creative
leeway here the metallic map on the
other hand is a bit more constrained it
essentially works like a black and white
mask that tells the Shader what is raw
metal and what is dialectric which means
non-metallic technically a surface is
either fully metallic or fully
dialectric there's no in between and so
your metallic map should look a little
bit like this now in reality metallic
surfaces are often mixed with
non-metallic elements such as dust rust
dirt and and so on so you need to
account for these when you create your
metallic map now in the case of our
material it should be fairly
straightforward the golden trim and the
mountings are going to be metallic
obviously so fully white but what about
the fabric well if we follow the PBR
textbook it should be completely black
so fully dialectric but we are going to
make an exception here because adding a
bit of metalness will help giving that
shimmery look that you often see in
Fabrics such as satin or silk this
effect is actually caused by a
phenomenon called anisotropy this is
something that we can replicate in
substance designer but it's a bit more
complex and advanced and we will not
deal with this in this tutorial we will
use instead the metallic trick because
it's just faster and easier but be aware
that you will need to control the look
of your material in the final engine
just to make sure it reacts properly to
lighting okay let's jump into it I'm
going to start by enabling the metallic
mapping or base material node and now we
need a grayscale base to start from I'm
going to go with something very simple
because again we need to think of it as
some sort of mask so no need for fine
gradients or noise we can start with a
uniform color node switch it to Grays
scale obviously and pick a medium
gray let's plug
this and now you see that right away a
material gets darker and we have some
nice Reflections going
on okay then i' like to make the
ornament weave pop out a bit more and
the way I'm going to do this is by
making it more metallic so that it looks
shinier than the rest so in this case
what we're going to do is blend this
base with the ornament weave mask that
we can find in our portal list here and
to make it more metallic all we have to
do is choose an additive mode like Max
then gently further down the opacity
here let me just switch the connection
mode to standard because otherwise it's
going to be a pain to reot these last
nodes so if you want to follow along
just go to connection so to
standard all right next up we have the
trim and ornaments that's easy because
these bits are expected to be fully
metallic so just grab the appropriate
mask that's trim and ornaments here then
add it on top with full
opacity now there's a catch here by
doing this we also made the gemstones
metallic and we don't really want that
this is the part where I tell you to
post the video and try to figure out the
solution for yourself
finished all right let me take another
blend this time fetch the gemstone
mask and simply subtract it from the
rest now we have a good metallic map if
we read what we have here it gives
something like slightly metallic fabric
with a bit more metallic ornaments fully
metallic trim and non-metallic
gemstones
perfect we can now frame this
metallic
okay now let's move on to the roughness
enable the roughness map in the base
material which gives this wet look to
our fabric because no input means full
black and full black means perfectly
smooth this map is going to be a bit
more detailed than the metallic map
because here we can play with the full
range of grayscale values so I'm
actually going to take the curvature map
and adjusted a little to use it as a
roughness base I have two adjustments in
mind the first one is to invert its
levels let me explain why if I zoom up
close and try to read this image in
terms of roughness information I see
that the cavities are darker and so will
look smoother right than the edges that
are highlighted here and so we look
rougher and usually in real life it's
the other way around cavities have more
surface irregularities because they
collect dust or microfibers whereas the
beads that stand out are smoother
because they are brushed or polished
more often I hope it makes sense so to
invert an input you could type in invert
in your search bar and grab that node
here that does just that but you could
also do it with levels and I actually
forgot to draw your attention to this
but on the tab itself you have this row
of icons that helps speed up some
actions so you have invert here and auto
LEL here I'm just going to click on
invert you could also do it manually by
dragging the keys but it just make
things a bit faster all right so we now
have a more convincing distribution of
value where the dark areas here are
going to look smoother than the light
bits here there's one more thing I like
to do though and it's toning down the
contrast because as it is things will
look too intense and noisy I could do it
with the levels note itself but I'd like
to introduce you to another interesting
note if we type in range we have this
histogram range note now the histogram
range does two things and to better
illustrate it I'm going to click on the
little tool that you have in the 2D view
the sort of bargraph icon that lets you
display the
histogram okay now what is the histogram
it's something that represents the
amount of pixels in your image for each
grayscale value where left means black
and right means white knowing that we
understand that this image for instance
has most of its pixels in the middle GD
here and so it's not very
contrasted if I take another one let me
grab for example this cell now this
image on the other hand has its pixels
spread out across the whole range and so
we have a more balanced distribution of
values here if you want to learn more
about histogram and levels I really
encourage you to check out this great
beginner friendly video we have on the
topic it's full of very intuitive
examples and it will just help you grasp
The Core Concepts now back to our node
here it comes with two sliders one that
can reduce the
range and one that can move it so keep
an eye on the histogram why I do that
see reducing the range is just shrinking
that
distribution until all the pixels in the
image share the same midg gray value
represented by that one line in the
middle and if I want to shift that line
so that instead of an average gray I
have something darker or lighter then I
can play with the position
slider easy right so let's just reset
this and let's say I want to lower the
contrast of our curvature all I have to
do is to drag this a little to the left
like so and depending on the look I'm
trying to achieve I can either darken it
or lighten it and what I like about
these two parameters is that they're
very easy to use and so when the time
comes to expose your parameters to the
final User it's just going to make
things easier all right let's disable
the histogram view for now next up we
have the ornament weave to tackle if we
follow the same step as in the metallic
map so let's add a blend and this time
all the Blends are going to be inverted
compared to the metallic so in the
metallic we wanted to add these elements
but in the roughness we will need to
remove them or rather to lower their
value so that they look more shiny so
here for the ornament weave we're going
to blend it in subtract mode
just so that it shimmers a bit
more all right then we have the
trim same
thing
subtract play with the
opacity and finally the
gemstones there we go we can now frame
this and col the roughness and metallic
Maps
done at this point of the process with
all the channels in place I like to take
a step back and find some things that
may not look right this is when I
usually start checking my material in
Ray traced mode to troubleshoot
issues we can do that in designer by
going to the 3D View and here you see we
have two renderers we have openg the one
we're currently using and that is here
for preview purposes only and then we
have Ira which is Ray Trace now you see
that when I switch to Ray tracing the
fabric looks really dark and rough all
of a sudden and we lose all the nice
Reflections that we had in preview mode
and that's because the normal is too
strong when we started building our hype
map we deliberately set pretty high
intensity to see things better now it's
making the weave too noisy and it kind
of breaks the shading so the first thing
we're going to do is drop the normal
intensity to two
okay that's already better then I think
we should maybe soften the base weave a
little because it still feels a bit too
intense and noisy in my
opinion now there are many ways I can do
it first I will blur the WFT threads a
little point
two okay then I will reduce the contrast
of the weave with a histogram range
again and here I need to make sure that
I stay roughly in the same values so
that the height blend that comes after
keeps the same
balance all right see the difference
we're just removing some of these spikes
here that made the fabric too noisy I
think it's better this way maybe one
more thing before we wrap this up I like
to make the pattern like the ornament
weave pop out just a little bit more in
the color so I'm going to add a quick
blend here just after the base weave
take the ornament weave mask and use the
same
input and just play with the blending
mode I think AD should work well if we
set up a very low
value all right it definitely
helps something that I like to do at
this stage is to put the material under
different lights you can find them in
the library down here in the HD section
so all you have to do is pick the hdri
you want to test drag and drop it in the
view port and then you know the drill
control shift right click to rotate and
inspect how your material behaves it's
probably my favorite thing to do in
designer
okay so in this video we went over the
creation of the roughness and metallic
Maps two important properties that help
bringing a fabric to life it looks like
we're done with the material creation
itself but there are actually two more
maps that I'd like to tackle in the next
video translucency and displacement it's
